<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE NIGHT RUN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Ralph Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On hand, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to relieve Fireman Cooper on the
Dover slow freight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks arose from the bench on
which he was seated in the roundhouse at Stanley
Junction.</p>
<p>Over a dozen men had been his companions for
the past hour. There were engineers waiting for
their runs, firemen resting after getting their
locomotives in order, and &#8220;extras,&#8221; who, like the
young railroader himself, were so far on the
substitute list only.</p>
<p>Ralph was glad of his appointment. This was
his second month of service as a fireman. It had
been by no means regular employment, and, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
he was industrious and ambitious, he was glad to
get at work with the prospect of a steady run.</p>
<p>The foreman of the roundhouse had just
turned from his desk after marking Ralph&#8217;s name
on the list when a man hurriedly entered the place.
He was rather unsteady in his gait, his face was
flushed, and he looked dissolute and unreliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the slow freight run, Forgan,&#8221; he
panted. &#8220;I&#8217;m listed next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two minutes late,&#8221; observed the foreman, in
a business-like way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t count on a stormy night like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;System counts in this establishment always,
Jim Evans,&#8221; said Mr. Forgan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran all the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stopped too long at the corner saloon, then,&#8221;
put in Dave Adams, a veteran engineer of the
road.</p>
<p>Evans glared at the man who spoke, but recognizing
a privileged character, stared down the
row of loiterers and demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s got my run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you own any particular run, Jim?&#8221; inquired
Adams, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Griscom&#8217;s was due me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Fairbanks was on hand, so it&#8217;s his run
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That kid&#8217;s,&#8221; sneered Evans, turning on Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
with angry eyes. &#8220;See here, young fellow, do
you think it&#8217;s square cutting in on a regular man
this way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer that,&#8221; interposed Tim Forgan
sharply. &#8220;He was here, you weren&#8217;t. He holds
the run till a better man comes along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evans stood glaring at Ralph for a few minutes.
Then he moved to the youth&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, kid,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;I want this run
specially. It&#8217;ll be a regular, for Cooper is going
with another road. I&#8217;m a man and must earn a
man&#8217;s wages. You&#8217;re only a kid. I&#8217;ve got a
family. Come, give me the run and I&#8217;ll treat you
handsomely,&#8221; and the speaker extended a cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I don&#8217;t smoke,&#8221; said Ralph. Then
looking the man squarely in the eyes, he said:
&#8220;Mr. Evans, I&#8217;ll give up the run on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Evans eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will sign the pledge, work steadily, and
give your wages to your family as you should
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; shouted Evans, not a whit shame-facedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; announced Forgan. &#8220;Fairbanks,
kindness is kindness, but business is business.
If you drop this run, it goes to the next
extra on the list according to routine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bah, you&#8217;re all down on me!&#8221; flared out
Evans, and left the place in a rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would do no good, Fairbanks, to help that
man,&#8221; observed Dave Adams. &#8220;He would sign
anything to secure a personal advantage and never
keep his word. He squanders all his money and
won&#8217;t last long in the Great Northern, I can tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went outside as he heard a whistle down
the rails. Evans was standing near a switch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some kind of a plot, eh, you and your
friend?&#8221; he sneered at Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean, Mr. Evans,&#8221;
replied Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you do. Forgan is partial to you.
The others don&#8217;t like me because I&#8217;m a crack man
in my line. One word, though; I&#8217;ll pay you off
for this some time or other,&#8221; and Evans left the
spot shaking his fist at Ralph menacingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the bad kind,&#8221; mused Ralph, looking
after the fellow, &#8220;not at all fit for duty half the
time. Here comes one of the good kind,&#8221; he
added as a freight engine with a long train of
cars attached steamed up at the roundhouse. &#8220;It&#8217;s
my run, Mr. Griscom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s famous news,&#8221; cried old John Griscom,
genuinely pleased.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Cooper,&#8221; said Ralph, as
the fireman leaped from the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; responded the latter. &#8220;You got the
run? Well, it&#8217;s a good man in a good man&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Griscom. &#8220;None better.
In to report, Sam? Good-bye. Shovel in the
coal, lad,&#8221; the speaker directed Ralph. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
bad night for railroading, and we&#8217;ll have a hard
run to Dover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph applied himself to his duties at once. He
opened the fire door, and as the ruddy glow
illuminated his face he was a picture pleasant to
behold.</p>
<p>Muscular, healthy, in love with his work,
friendly, earnest and accommodating, Ralph Fairbanks
was a favorite with every fair-minded railroad
man on the Great Northern who knew him.</p>
<p>Ralph had lived at Stanley Junction nearly all
of his life. His early experiences in railroading
have been related in the first volume of the present
series, entitled &#8220;Ralph of the Roundhouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s father had been one of the pioneers
who helped to build the Great Northern. When
he died, however, it was found that the twenty
thousand dollars&#8217; worth of stock in the road he
was supposed to own had mysteriously disappeared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>Further, his home was mortgaged to old
Gasper Farrington, a wealthy magnate of the
village. This person seemed to have but one object
in life; to drive the widow Fairbanks and
her son from Stanley Junction.</p>
<p>Ralph one day overheard Farrington threaten
to foreclose a mortgage, and the youth suddenly
realized his responsibilities. Leaving school, he
secured a job in the roundhouse at Stanley Junction.
Here, notwithstanding the plots, hatred and
malice of a worthless, good-for-nothing fellow
named Ike Slump, whose place he took, Ralph
made fine progress. He saved the railroad shops
from wholesale destruction, by assisting John
Griscom to run an engine into the flames and
drive a car of powder out of the way. For this
brave deed Ralph secured the friendship of the
master mechanic of the road and was promoted
to the position of junior leverman.</p>
<p>In the second volume of this series, entitled
&#8220;Ralph in the Switch Tower,&#8221; another vivid
phase of his ability and merit has been depicted.
He rendered signal service in saving a special
from disaster and prevented a treasure train from
being looted by thieves.</p>
<p>Among the thieves was his old-time enemy, Ike
Slump, and a crony of his named Mort Bemis.
They had been hired by Farrington to harass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Ralph in every way possible. Ralph had searched
for the motive to the old man&#8217;s animosity.</p>
<p>He learned that Farrington had appropriated
his father&#8217;s railroad stock on an illegal technicality,
and that the mortgage on their homestead had
once been paid by Mr. Fairbanks.</p>
<p>Once knowing this, Ralph undertook the task
of proving it. It required some clever work to
unmask the villainous miser, but Ralph succeeded,
and Farrington, to escape facing disgrace, left the
town, ostensibly for Europe.</p>
<p>In unmasking the old man Ralph was assisted
by one Van Sherwin, a poor boy whom he had
befriended. Van and a former partner of Gasper
Farrington, named Farwell Gibson, had secured
a charter to build a short line railroad near Dover,
in which project Ralph was very much interested.</p>
<p>As has been said, Ralph had now been a fireman
for two months, but heretofore employed in
yard service only.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the chance of my life,&#8221; he cried cheerily,
as he piled in the coal, &#8220;and what a famous partner
is dear, bluff, honest old John Griscom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t have me for a partner long, lad,&#8221; replied
the veteran engineer with a slight sigh, as he
moved the lever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Mr. Griscom?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eyes giving out. Had to drop the Daylight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Express. I&#8217;m going down the ladder, you are
going up the ladder. Stick to your principles, lad,
for they are good ones, as I well know, and you&#8217;ll
surely reach the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>The locomotive gave a sharp signal whistle,
and the slow freight started on its night run for
Dover.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE LANDSLIDE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Trouble ahead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And danger. Quick! slow down, or we&#8217;re in
for a wreck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks spoke with suddenness. As
he did so he leaped past the engineer in a flash,
clearing the open window space at the side.</p>
<p>Two minutes previous the old engineer had
asked him to go out on the locomotive to adjust
some fault in the air gauge. Ralph had just attended
to this when he made a startling discovery.</p>
<p>In an instant he was in action and landed on
the floor of the cab. He sprang to his own side
of the engine, and leaning far out peered keenly
ahead.</p>
<p>They were now in a deep cut which ended a
steep climb, and the engine had full steam on and
was making fairly good speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My bad eyes&mdash;&#8221; began Griscom, and then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
quivered in every nerve, for a tremendous shock
nearly sent him off his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in time,&#8221; cried Ralph, and then he held
his breath.</p>
<p>Slowing down, the train had come to a crashing
halt. The locomotive reared upon its forward
wheels and then settled back on a slant, creaking
at every joint. Ralph had swung the air lever or
there would have been a catastrophe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221; gasped Griscom, clearing his
old eyes and peering ahead, but Ralph was gone.
Seizing a lantern, he had jumped to the ground
and was at the front of the locomotive now. The
engineer shut off all steam after sounding the
danger signal, a series of several sharp whistles,
and quickly joined his assistant.</p>
<p>In front of the locomotive, obstructing the rails
completely, was a great mass of dirt, gravel and
rocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;A landslide,&#8221; spoke Griscom, glancing up one
steep side of the cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had struck that big rock full force,&#8221;
observed Ralph, &#8220;it would have been a bad
wreck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved us just in time,&#8221; cried the old
engineer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often wondered if some day
there wouldn&#8217;t be just such a drop as this of some
of these overhanging cliffs. Company ought to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
see to it. It&#8217;s been a fierce rain all the evening,
perhaps that loosened the mass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Ralph thoughtfully, and then,
inspecting a glazed piece of paper with some
printing on it he had just picked up, he looked
queerly at his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give them the trouble signal in the caboose,
please, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; said the young fireman.
&#8220;I think I had better get back there at once. Have
you a revolver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always carry one,&#8221; responded Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it handy, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; cried the engineer with a stare. &#8220;What
you getting at, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is no landslide,&#8221; replied Ralph, pointing
at the obstruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Train wreckers&mdash;or worse,&#8221; declared Ralph
promptly. &#8220;There is no time to lose, Mr. Griscom,&#8221;
he continued in rapid tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, if not an accident, there was a
purpose in it,&#8221; muttered Griscom, reaching into
his tool box for a weapon, &#8220;but what makes you
think it wasn&#8217;t an accident?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not reply, for he was gone. Springing
across the coal heaped up in the tender, he
climbed to the top of the first freight car and
started on a swift run the length of the train.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>The young fireman was considerably excited.
He would not have been a spirited, wide-awake
boy had he been otherwise. The paper he had
found among the debris of the obstruction on the
rails had an ominous sentence across it, namely,
&#8220;<i>Handle With Care, Dynamite</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, taken in connection with what had at
first startled him, made Ralph feel pretty sure
that he had not missed his guess in attributing the
landslide to some agency outside of nature.</p>
<p>While adjusting the air gauge Ralph had noticed
a flare ahead, then a lantern light up the side
of the embankment, and then, in the blaze of a
wild flash of lightning, he had witnessed the
descent of a great tearing, tossing mass, landing
in the railroad cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can mean only a hold-up,&#8221; theorized Ralph.
&#8220;Yes, I am quite right.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slowed down in his wild dash over the car
tops, and proceeded with caution. Down at the
end of the train he saw lights that he knew did
not belong to the train hands.</p>
<p>Ralph neared the caboose and then dropped
flat to the top of the car he was on. Peering past
its edge, he made out a wagon, half-a-dozen men,
and the train hands backed to the side of the cut
and held captive there by two of the strangers,
who menaced them with revolvers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Then two others of the marauding gang took
crowbars from the wagon, and one, carrying a
lantern, proceeded along the side of the cars inspecting
the freight cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must know of some valuable goods on
the train,&#8221; reflected Ralph.</p>
<p>It was an ideal spot for a train robbery, between
two stations, and no train was due for
several hours.</p>
<p>Ralph was in a quandary as to his best course
of procedure. For a moment he considered going
for Griscom and arming himself with a bar of
rod.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be six to two and we would get the
worst of it,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;There is only one thing
to do&mdash;get back to Brocton. It&#8217;s less than a mile.
Can I make it before these fellows get away with
their plunder? Good! a patent coupler.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy fireman had crept to the end of the
car next to the caboose. Glancing down, he discovered
that the couplings were operated by a
lever bar. Otherwise, he could never have forced
up the coupling pin.</p>
<p>The cars were on a sharp incline, in fact, one of
the steepest on the road. Ralph relied on simple
gravity to escape the robbers and hasten for relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Careful as Ralph was, he was discovered. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
voice rang out in warning. Then with a quick,
bold snap, Ralph lifted the coupler and the pin
shot out. He sprang to the forward platform of
the caboose. As the car began to recede, he
dashed through its open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in time. Whew!&#8221; ejaculated Ralph,
&#8220;those fellows are desperate men and doing this
in true, wild western style.&#8221;</p>
<p>The caboose, once started, began a rapid backward
rush. Ralph feared that its momentum
might carry the car from the track.</p>
<p>A curve turned, and the lights of Brocton were
in sight. Before the runaway caboose slowed
down entirely it must have gone fully three-quarters
of a mile.</p>
<p>Ralph jumped from the car, and ran down the
tracks at his best speed. He was breathless as he
reached the little depot. It was dark and deserted,
but opposite it was the one business street
of the town.</p>
<p>Ralph left the tracks finally and made a dash
for the open entrance of the general store of the
village. The usual crowd of loiterers was gathered
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s this?&#8221; cried the proprietor, as
the young fireman rushed wildly into the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fireman on the Dover freight,&#8221; explained
Ralph breathlessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble&mdash;a wreck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a hold-up. Men! get weapons, a handcar,
if there is one here, and we may head off the
robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took some urging to get that slow crowd
into action, but finally half-a-dozen men armed
with shotguns were running down the tracks following
Ralph&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>It was a steep climb and several fell behind,
out of breath. One big fellow kept pace with
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they are,&#8221; spoke the latter as they
rounded a curve.</p>
<p>Lights showed in the near distance. A flash of
lightning momentarily revealed a stirring scene.
The robbers were removing packages from a car
they had broken into, and these they were loading
into their wagon at the side of the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up, hurry up!&#8221; Ralph&#8217;s companion
shouted back to his comrades. &#8220;Now, then, for
a dash, and we&#8217;ll bag those rogues, plunder, rig
and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; ordered Ralph sharply.</p>
<p>He was too late. The impetuous villager was
greatly excited and he ran ahead and fired off his
gun, two of the others following his example.</p>
<p>Ralph was very sorry for this, for almost instantly
the robbers took the alarm and all lights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
near the caboose were extinguished. The echo of
rapid orders reached the ears of the relief party.
Fairly upon the scene, a flash of lightning showed
the wagon being driven rapidly up a road leading
from the cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out for yourselves,&#8221; suggested Ralph.
&#8220;Those men are armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So are we, now!&#8221; sharply sounded the voice
of one of the men from Brocton, and another
flash of lightning showed the enemy still in view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up the road after them!&#8221; came a second
order.</p>
<p>Ralph ran up to the side of the caboose.</p>
<p>&#8220;All safe?&#8221; he inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;All but one of us,&#8221; responded the conductor.</p>
<p>Ralph lit a lantern, noticing one of the train
hands lying on the ground motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a fighter, Tom is,&#8221; said the conductor.
&#8220;He resisted and grappled with one of the robbers,
and another of them knocked him senseless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this in his hand?&#8221; inquired Ralph.
&#8220;Oh, I see&mdash;a cap. Snatched it from the head of
his assailant, I suppose. Hark! they are shooting
up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shots rang out along the cut road. In a few
minutes, however, the men from Brocton reappeared
in the cut.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No use wasting our lives recklessly,&#8221; said one
of them. &#8220;They have bullets, we only small shot.
The wagon got away. We&#8217;ll hurry back to Brocton,
get a regular posse armed with rifles, and
search the country for the rascals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the damage?&#8221; inquired Ralph of the
conductor, going to the side of the car that had
been broken open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty big, I should say,&#8221; responded the conductor.
&#8220;That car had a consignment of valuable
silks from Brown &amp; Banks, in the city, and they
piled a fair load of it into their wagon. You have
saved a wholesale plundering of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men from Brocton departed. Ralph helped
the train crew revive the poor fellow who had
been knocked insensible. They carried him into
the caboose, applied cold water to his head, and
soon had him restored to consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fix the red lights,&#8221; ordered the conductor to
a brakeman, &#8220;and then hurry to Brocton and have
them telegraph the train dispatcher. What&#8217;s the
trouble ahead, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph explained. Shovels and crowbars were
brought from the caboose, and two of the train
crew accompanied him back to the locomotive.</p>
<p>Ralph thought of the cap he had stuck in his
pocket. He looked it over carefully in the light
of the lantern he carried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>On the leather band inside of the cap were two
initials in red ink&mdash;&#8220;I. S.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ike Slump,&#8221; murmured Ralph.</p>
<p>An old-time enemy had appeared on the scene,
and the young fireman of the Great Northern
knew that he would have to keep a sharp lookout
or there would be more trouble.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>EVERYBODY&#8217;S FRIEND</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Stand back there, you fellows!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scatter, boys&mdash;it&#8217;s Ralph Fairbanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was two days after the landslide near Brocton.
The young fireman had just left the roundhouse
at Stanley Junction in a decidedly pleasant
mood. His cheering thoughts were, however,
rudely disturbed by a spectacle that at once appealed
to his manly nature.</p>
<p>Ralph, making a short cut for home, had come
across a farmer&#8217;s wagon standing in an alley at the
side of a cheap hotel. The place was a resort for
dissolute, good-for-nothing railway employes,
and one of its victims was now seated, or rather
propped up, on the seat of the wagon in question.</p>
<p>He was a big, loutish boy, and had apparently
come into town with a load to deliver. The
wagon was filled with bags of apples. Around
the vehicle was gathered a crowd of boys. Each
one of them had his pockets bulging with the
fruit stolen from one of the bags in the wagon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Standing near by, Jim Evans in their midst,
was an idle crowd of railroad men, enjoying and
commenting on the scene.</p>
<p>The farmer&#8217;s boy was seemingly asleep or unconscious.
He had been set up on the seat by the
mob, and one side of his face blackened up. Apples
stuck all over the harness of the horses and on
every available part of the vehicle. A big board
lying across the bags had chalked upon it, &#8220;Take
One.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd was just about to start this spectacle
through the public streets of Stanley Junction
when Ralph appeared. The young fireman
brushed them aside quickly, removed the adornments
from the horses and wagon, sprang to the
vehicle, threw the sign overboard, and, lifting up
the unconscious driver, placed him out of view
under the wagon seat. As he did so, Ralph
noticed the taint of liquor on the breath of the
country lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; he murmured to himself. &#8220;This
doesn&#8217;t look right&mdash;more like a piece of malice or
mischief. Stand back, there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph took up the reins, and also seized the
whip. Many of the crowd he had known as school
chums, and most of them drew back shamefacedly
as he appeared.</p>
<p>There were four or five regular young loafers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
however, who led the mob. Among them Ralph
recognized Ted Evans, a son of the fireman he
had encountered at the roundhouse two days
previous. With him was a fellow named Hemp
Gaston, an old associate of Mort Bemis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, there!&#8221; sang out Gaston, grabbing
the bridles of the horses. &#8220;What you spoiling
our fun for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added Ted Evans, springing to the
wagon step and seizing Ralph&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Get off
that wagon, or we&#8217;ll pull you off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph swung the fellow free of the vehicle
with a vigorous push.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, you interfere with my boy and I&#8217;ll
take a hand in this affair myself,&#8221; growled Jim
Evans, advancing from the crowd of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll whip me first, if you do,&#8221; answered one
of them. &#8220;This is a boys&#8217; squabble, Jim Evans,
and don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! he struck my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let them fight it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; shouted young Evans angrily, &#8220;come
down here and show that you are no coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Ralph promptly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
one for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks had acted in a flash on an
impulse. He had leaped from the wagon, dealt
young Evans one blow and sent him half-stunned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
to the ground. Regaining the wagon he drove
quickly into the street before his astonished
enemies could act any further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow,&#8221; said Ralph, looking at the lad
in the wagon. &#8220;Now, what am I ever going to do
with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph reflected for a moment or two. Then
he started in the direction of home. He was
sleepy and tired out, and he realized that the
present episode might interfere with some of his
plans for the day, but he was a whole-hearted,
sympathetic boy and could not resist the promptings
of his generous nature.</p>
<p>The young fireman soon reached the pretty
little cottage that was his home, so recently rescued
from the sordid clutches of old Gasper Farrington.
He halted the team in front of the place
and entered the house at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, mother,&#8221; he said cheerily.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairbanks greeted him with a smile of
glad welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was quite anxious about you when I heard
of the wreck, Ralph,&#8221; she said with solicitude.
He had not been home since that happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not a wreck, mother,&#8221; corrected Ralph.
Then he briefly recited the incidents of the hold-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as though you were destined to meet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
with all kinds of danger in your railroad life,&#8221;
said the widow. &#8220;You were delayed considerably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph, &#8220;we had to remove the
landslide debris. That took us six hours and
threw us off our schedule, so we had to lay over
at Dover all day yesterday. One pleasant thing,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that, Ralph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The master mechanic congratulated me this
morning on what he called, &#8216;saving the train.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you certainly did, Ralph. Why, whose
wagon is that in front of the house?&#8221; inquired
Mrs. Fairbanks, observing the vehicle outside for
the first time.</p>
<p>Ralph explained the circumstances of his rescue
of the vehicle to his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with the farmer&#8217;s
boy?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to bring him in the house until he
recovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I will make up a bed on the lounge
for him,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;It is too bad, poor
fellow! and shameful&mdash;the mischief of those men
at the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph carried the farmer&#8217;s boy into the house.
Then he ate his breakfast. After the meal was
finished, he glanced at his watch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to lose a little sleep, mother,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I am anxious to help the poor fellow out,
and I think I see a way to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman had noticed a small blank
book under the cushion of the wagon seat. He now
inspected it for the first time. All of its written
pages were crossed out except one. This contained
a list of names of storekeepers in Stanley
Junction.</p>
<p>Ralph drove to the store first named in the list.
Within two hours he had delivered all of the
apples. It seemed that the storekeepers named
in the account book ordered certain fruits and
vegetables regularly from the owner of the team,
the farmer himself coming to town to collect for
the same twice each month.</p>
<p>When Ralph got back home he unhitched the
horses, tied them up near the woodshed, and fed
them from a bag of grain he found under the
wagon seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is this, I wonder?&#8221; he said, discovering
a small flat parcel under the wagon seat. The
package resembled a store purchase of some kind,
so, for safe keeping, Ralph placed it inside the
shed.</p>
<p>His mother had gone to visit a sick neighbor.
The farmer boy was sleeping heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake me before the boy leaves,&#8221; he wrote on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
a card, leaving this for his mother on the kitchen
table. Then, pretty well tired out, Ralph went to
bed.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when he awoke.
He went down stairs and glanced into the sitting
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;where is the
farmer boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left two hours ago, Ralph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Then why didn&#8217;t you wake me
up? I left a card for you on the kitchen table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not find it,&#8221; said the widow, and then a
search revealed the card where the wind had
blown it under the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did the boy say?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me his name was Zeph Dallas. I
talked to him about his misfortunes of the morning,
and he broke down and cried. Then he went
out to the wagon. He found an account book
there, and said you must have delivered his load
for him, and that he would never forget your
kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a package in the wagon,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke of that, and said some one must
have stolen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure he didn&#8217;t find it later?&#8221; inquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Ralph. &#8220;It was in the woodshed, where I placed
it for safe keeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went out to the shed, and found the
package where he had left it. He returned to the
house with it, ate a hurried meal, and hastened
down town. He learned that Zeph had called at
several stores. The farmer boy appeared to have
discovered Ralph&#8217;s interest in his behalf, and had
driven home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what there is in the package?&#8221;
mused Ralph, when he again reached the cottage.
&#8220;I had better open it and find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman was quite startled as he untied
the parcel and glanced at its contents. The
package contained two bolts of silk, and the tags
on them bore the name of the firm which, Ralph
had learned at Dover, had shipped the goods
stolen from the slow freight two nights previous.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>AN OLD-TIME ENEMY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;New engine, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Mr. Griscom, as you well know,&#8221;
answered Ralph.</p>
<p>The veteran engineer chuckled, but he continued
looking over the locomotive with admiring
eyes.</p>
<p>The young fireman had come to work early
that afternoon. The roundhouse men were careless
and he decided to show them what &#8220;elbow
grease&#8221; and industry could do. In an hour he
had the old freight locomotive looking indeed like
a new engine.</p>
<p>They steamed out of the roundhouse and were
soon at the head of their freight train.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a little time to spare,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half-an-hour before we have to leave, you
know, lad,&#8221; said Griscom. &#8220;What&#8217;s troubling
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to see Bob Adair, the road detective.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About the silk robbery?&#8221; inquired the engineer
with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something new?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerable, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might find him in the depot offices. Run
down and see. I&#8217;ll attend to things here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Mr. Griscom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph hurried away from the freight train.
He wished to report about the discovery of the
silk, and hunt up Zeph Dallas at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly believe the farmer boy a thief,&#8221;
mused Ralph, &#8220;but he must explain his possession
of that silk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman did not find Adair at the
depot, and came back to the engine to discover
Jim Evans lounging in the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been helping Griscom out,&#8221; grinned the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, get out, now,&#8221; growled Griscom. &#8220;Time
to start up. There&#8217;s the signal from the conductor.
That man has been hanging around the
engine ever since you left,&#8221; the old engineer continued
to Ralph, &#8220;and he is too good-natured to
suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing out of order,&#8221; reported the youth,
looking about the cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, lad, for a run on time,&#8221; said Griscom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
&#8220;This run has been late a good deal, and I don&#8217;t
want to get a bad name. When I ran the Daylight
Express it was my pride and boast that we
were always on time to the minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>They made good time out of Stanley Junction
to Afton. Ten miles beyond, however, there was
a jolt, a slide and difficult progress on a bit of upgrade
rails.</p>
<p>So serious was the difficulty that Griscom
stopped the train and got out to investigate. He
returned to the cab with a set, grim face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grease,&#8221; he reported; &#8220;some one has been
tampering with the rails. Spite work, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was fully an hour&#8217;s delay, but a liberal
application of sand to the rails helped them out.
Five miles later on the locomotive began to puff
and jerk. With full steam on, the engine did only
half duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water gauge all right,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Griscom, &#8220;and I can tell it in two
words&mdash;Jim Evans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean, Mr. Griscom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t come into the cab for nothing. Yes,
we are victims of the old trick&mdash;soap in the water
and the valves are clogged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do about it?&#8221; inquired
Ralph anxiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pump out the water at the next tank and take
a new supply on.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a further delay of nearly two hours.
Once more they started up. Ten miles from
Dover, a few seconds after Ralph had thrown in
coal, a terrible explosion threw the fire cover open
and singed and burned both engineer and fireman.</p>
<p>Griscom looked angry, for the fire now needed
mending.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lad,&#8221; he said grimly, &#8220;these tricks are done
to scare you and delay the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not scared one particle,&#8221; retorted Ralph,
&#8220;only this strikes me as a dangerous piece of mischief&mdash;putting
explosives in among the coal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Evans did it,&#8221; positively asserted Griscom.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what he sneaked into the cab for, and he
has confederates along the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph said nothing but he resolved to call
Evans to account when he returned to Stanley
Junction.</p>
<p>They were over an hour late on the run. Returning
to Stanley Junction, they were delayed by
a wreck and the time record was bad at both ends
of the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; said Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll mend it, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; declared the
young fireman, and he did not go home when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
reached Stanley Junction, but proceeded at once
to the home of Jim Evans.</p>
<p>Ralph knocked at the open door, but no one
answered the summons and he stepped to the door
of the sitting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any one here?&#8221; he called out through the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? oh&mdash;no,&#8221; answered a muffled voice, and
a man in the adjoining room got up quickly and
fairly ran out through the rear door.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer,&#8221; commented Ralph. &#8220;That man
actually ran away from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma has gone after pa,&#8221; lisped a little urchin
in the kitchen. &#8220;Man wants to see him. What
for funny man run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph hurried past the infantile questioner and
after the object of his curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the man did look funny, for a fact,&#8221; said
Ralph. &#8220;He was disguised. There he is. Hey,
there! whoever you are, a word with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was now in close pursuit of a scurrying
figure. The object of his curiosity turned to look
at him, stumbled, and went headlong into a ditch.</p>
<p>Ralph came to the spot. The man lay groaning
where he had fallen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me,&#8221; he muttered&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m nearly
stunned.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph as he assisted the
man to his feet, &#8220;it is Gasper Farrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the village magnate, disguised. He
stood regarding Ralph with savage eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had gone to Europe, Mr. Farrington,&#8221;
said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you? Well, I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; growled Farrington,
nursing a bruise on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay in Stanley Junction,
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it is,&#8221; retorted Ralph quickly. &#8220;You
owe us thousands of dollars, and we want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll collect by law, then. I&#8217;ll never give you
a cent willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph regarded the man thoughtfully for a
minute or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Farrington,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have come to the
conclusion that you are trying to make me more
trouble. This man Evans is up to mischief, and
I believe that you have incited him to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnate was silent, regarding Ralph with
menacing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn you that it won&#8217;t pay, and that you
won&#8217;t succeed,&#8221; continued Ralph. &#8220;What do you
hope to accomplish by persecuting me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old man glanced all about him. Then he
spoke out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I give you one last
chance&mdash;get out of Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; demanded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have humiliated me and we can&#8217;t
live in the same town together, that&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You deserved humiliation,&#8221; responded Ralph
steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, take your own view of the case. I
will settle your claim for five thousand dollars
and pay you the money at once, if you will leave
Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not take one cent less than the full
twenty thousand dollars due us,&#8221; announced
Ralph staunchly, &#8220;and I shall not leave Stanley
Junction as long as my mother wants to live
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Gasper Farrington, venomously,
as he walked from the spot, &#8220;look out for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went back to the Evans home, but found
only the little child there. He concluded he
would not wait for Evans that evening. The
discovery of his old-time enemy, Farrington, had
been enlightening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have a talk with mother about this,&#8221; he
mused.</p>
<p>When Ralph reached home a surprise greeted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
him. The little parlor was lighted up, indicating
a visitor. He glanced in through the open windows.</p>
<p>The visitor was Zeph Dallas, the farmer boy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ON SPECIAL DUTY</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph entered the house glad of an opportunity
to interview the farmer boy, who had been
in his thoughts considerably during the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dallas, this is my son, Ralph,&#8221; said Mrs.
Fairbanks, as the young fireman came into the
parlor.</p>
<p>The visitor arose from his chair in an awkward,
embarrassed fashion. He flushed and stammered
as he grasped Ralph&#8217;s extended hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brought you a sack of potatoes and some
apples,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Neighbor gave me a lift in his
wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; returned Ralph with a friendly
smile. &#8220;Well, Mr. Dallas, I am very glad to see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladder than you were last time, I reckon,&#8221;
said Zeph. &#8220;Say, I&mdash;I want to say I am ashamed
of myself, and I want to thank you for all you
did for me. It&#8217;s made me your friend for life,
so I came to ask a favor of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>This was rather a queer way of putting the
case, thought Ralph, and the fellow blundered on.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Mr. Ames, that&#8217;s the man who hired
me, found out about my doings down here at
Stanley Junction, and he has set me adrift.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is too bad,&#8221; observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it ain&#8217;t, for I deserve better work,&#8221; dissented
Zeph. &#8220;They say you&#8217;re dreadfully smart
and everybody&#8217;s friend, and I want you to help
me get where I want to get.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I am willing to try to assist you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly which I had better do,&#8221;
proceeded Zeph&mdash;&#8220;become a chief of police or a
railroad conductor. Of course, the man who
speaks quickest and will pay the most money gets
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph concealed a smile, for Zeph was entirely
in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see,&#8221; remarked the young fireman,
&#8220;it is somewhat difficult to get just the position
you want without some experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; declared the farmer boy
confidently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought it all out. I once
watched a conductor go through a train. Why,
it&#8217;s no work at all. I could do it easily. And as
to being a detective I&#8217;ve read lots of books on the
subject, and I&#8217;ve even got some disguises I made
up, in my satchel here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, brought your satchel, too, did you?&#8221; observed
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I thought maybe you&#8217;d house
me for a day or two till I closed a contract with
somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow was so simple-minded that Mrs.
Fairbanks pitied him, and, observing this, Ralph
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Zeph, and I will later talk
over with you the prospects of a situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitor was soon completely at home. He
ate a hearty supper, and, after the meal, took some
home-made disguises from his satchel. The poor
fellow strutted around proudly as he put these
on in turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Old peddler,&#8221; he announced, donning a skull
cap, a white beard made out of rope, and a big
pair of goggles. &#8220;Tramp,&#8221; and he put on a
ragged coat and a torn cap, and acted out the
appearance of a typical tramp quite naturally.
There were several other representations, but all
so crude and funny that Ralph with difficulty
restrained his merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;How will it do?&#8221; inquired Zeph, at the conclusion
of the performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have got the elements of the profession
in mind,&#8221; said Ralph guardedly, &#8220;but there is the
practical end of the business to learn.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>Then Ralph seriously and earnestly told his
visitor the real facts of the case. He devoted a
full hour to correcting Zeph&#8217;s wrong impressions
of detective and railroad work. By the time
he got through, Zeph&#8217;s face was glum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if what you say is true,&#8221; he remarked
dejectedly, &#8220;I&#8217;m next to being good for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;don&#8217;t you be discouraged
at all. You have the starting point of every
ambition&mdash;an idea. I myself do not think much
of the detective line for one as young as you are.
As to railroading, I can tell you one fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; interrogated Zeph dreamily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must begin at the bottom of the ladder
and take one step at a time&mdash;slow steps, sure
steps, to reach the top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fireman, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Zeph,
admiringly.</p>
<p>Ralph answered that he was, and this led to his
relating to the curious and interested Zeph the
story of his career from roundhouse worker and
switch tower man to the present position.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fascinating, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Zeph, with a
long-drawn breath, when Ralph concluded his recital.
&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll give up the detective idea.
Can you help me get a position in the roundhouse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to try,&#8221; assented Ralph. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
are strong and used to hard work, and that means
a good deal in the roundhouse service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph suggested a stroll before bedtime. Zeph
was glad for the exercise. Once they were outside,
Ralph broached a subject he had been thinking
over all the evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to ask you a very
important question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember the day I kept your team for
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You missed a package that had been under the
feed bags when you came to leave town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and that&#8217;s why I am here,&#8221; said Zeph.
&#8220;Old Ames was almost ready to discharge me for
letting those men at the hotel give me drink I had
never tasted before and getting in that fix you
found me in, and for losing some of the apples,
but when he found out that I had lost that package,
he was nearly wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there something so valuable in it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno. I only know I was told to be sure I
kept it hidden and safe till it was delivered to a
fellow named Evans in town here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Evans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the full name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked pretty serious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You see, old Ames himself didn&#8217;t send the
package,&#8221; went on Zeph. &#8220;It was brought to the
house by a fellow who had hired a team from
Ames one day last week. Dunno who he is,
dunno where he lives, but I can describe him, if
you are interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am interested, very much so,&#8221; assented
Ralph.</p>
<p>Zeph went on to describe the person he had
alluded to. By the time he had concluded, it was
evident to Ralph that the sender of the package
was Ike Slump.</p>
<p>The young fireman took Zeph back to the house
but did not enter it himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be back soon, Zeph,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
some business down town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went at once to the home of Bob Adair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to see me, Fairbanks?&#8221; questioned the
brisk, wide-awake railroad detective, as Ralph
was shown into the room where he was busily
engaged in packing a satchel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Adair, about the silk robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that mystery,&#8221; nodded the detective. &#8220;I
spent two days on it, and didn&#8217;t find a clew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had one, but failed to find you,&#8221; explained
Ralph. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all about it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick work, then, Fairbanks,&#8221; went on Adair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
&#8220;for I&#8217;m due for a special to the city. Big case
from the General Superintendent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph rapidly related all he had learned. Adair
listened intently. He reflected for a moment or
two after the young fireman had finished his recital.
Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks, this is of great importance, but I
can&#8217;t neglect the city case. You helped me on
another similar case once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also aided me in running down those switch
tower wreckers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, and you did nobly in those affairs.
Let me think. Yes, I&#8217;ll do it! Here, I want you
to go straight to the Assistant Superintendent at
Afton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right away. I will give you a letter. No,
hold on, I&#8217;ve got a better plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Adair consulted his watch. Bustlingly
he hurried through with his preparations for departure.
Then he left the house, swung down
the street briskly, and, Ralph accompanying him,
proceeded to the railroad depot.</p>
<p>He wrote out a long telegram and handed it to
the night operator. Then he came back to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Fairbanks,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
fixed this thing as I want it, and you are one of
the few persons I would trust in a matter like
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Adair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your ability from past experience. It
won&#8217;t do to neglect following this clew to the silk
robbers. I have wired the assistant superintendent
for an official request that you be detailed
on special duty in my department. Wait here for
the reply. Then start out on the trail of those
thieves, and report to me day after to-morrow,
when I shall return to Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;I may be able to accomplish
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will, judging from your present
success in assisting me,&#8221; said Adair.</p>
<p>Ralph had to wait nearly an hour after Adair
had left on a special. Then a reply came to the
telegram. The operator, as instructed by Adair,
handed the message to Ralph. It read:</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks, freight fireman, detailed for special
work in another department.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Ralph to himself, as he
started homewards. &#8220;Now to trace down Ike
Slump and the other train robbers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>ZEPH</h3>
</div>
<p>The young fireman reported at the roundhouse
early in the morning, showing the telegram to Jim
Forgan, but not until the foreman had got out of
sight and hearing of the other men in the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; commented Forgan laconically, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Mr. Forgan?&#8221; smiled Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s the truth of it&mdash;for two
reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they, Mr. Forgan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, it interrupts a regular run for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I may not be away two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, it gives that Jim Evans a chance to take
your place, and I don&#8217;t trust the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; said Ralph pointedly, &#8220;and I
may have something important to tell you about
him when I return.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph found Zeph industriously chopping
kindling wood when he got back home again. The
young fireman went into the house, explained his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
new employment to his mother, and then called to
Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted some work, Zeph,&#8221; he said to the
farmer boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I do,&#8221; cried Zeph with unction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I think I am authorized to offer
you a dollar a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady job?&#8221; inquired Zeph eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it may not last, but it is in the railroad
service, and may lead to your further employment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; commented Zeph. &#8220;What do they
want me to do&mdash;engineer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely, Zeph,&#8221; said Ralph, smiling. &#8220;I
simply want you to take me back to the Ames
farm and direct me about the locality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s that kind of work got to do with
railroading?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall know later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You&#8217;re too smart to make any mistakes
and too friendly to do anything but good
for me, so I&#8217;m your man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. First, then, tell me the location of
the Ames farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph did this, and Ralph ascertained that it
was about five miles west of Brocton.</p>
<p>Ralph secured some money, and in an hour he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and Zeph stepped aboard the cab of a locomotive
attached to a load of empties due to run down the
line in a few minutes.</p>
<p>They reached Brocton about noon. Ralph proceeded
down the tracks towards the railroad cut
which had been the scene of the landslide.</p>
<p>He turned off at the wagon road and soon, with
his companion, was started westward in the direction
of the Ames farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you hear anything of a
train robbery here the other night?&#8221;</p>
<p>No, Zeph had not heard of it. Then Ralph
questioned him closely as to the night Ames had
loaned his wagon to strangers and gained a few
more particulars relating to the silk robbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the Ames farm,&#8221; reported Zeph at
last.</p>
<p>Ralph had already planned out what he would
do, and proceeded to instruct his assistant as to
his share in the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do not wish to be seen by
Ames, nor must he know that you came here with
a stranger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph, taking a package from
under his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s the package I lost!&#8221; cried Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you had it all the time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did, Zeph, yes. No mystery about it&mdash;I
simply don&#8217;t care to explain to you anything about
it till a little later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to take it and go up to the farmhouse.
I will keep out of sight. You go to Ames
and tell him it was returned to you, and you want
to give it back to the person it belongs to with a
message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s,&#8221; answered Ralph, &#8220;but you need
not say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him you want to advise the person who
sent the parcel that it isn&#8217;t safe to send such goods
to any one at the present time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;Suppose Ames tells
me where to find the fellow who sent the package?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back and report to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph started for the farmhouse. Ralph
watched him enter it, the package in his hand. He
came out in a very few minutes without the
parcel.</p>
<p>He was rather glum-faced when he rejoined
Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;I&#8217;ve found out nothing,
and old Ames took the package away from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me he would see that it was returned
to the person who sent it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That delays matters,&#8221; thought Ralph, &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t know whether Ames will take it back to the
silk thieves, or wait for some of them to visit
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the young fireman formed a sudden resolution.
He regarded his companion thoughtfully,
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph, I am going to trust you with what is
known as an official secret in the railroad line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The farmer boy looked pleased and interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are too square and friendly to
betray that secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me, and see!&#8221; cried Zeph with ardor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;there was a silk robbery
of the Dover night freight last week, the train I
am fireman on. From what you have told me, I
feel sure that the thieves hired their rig from
Ames. That package you had was part of the
stolen plunder. I am acting for the road detective
of the Great Northern, and I must locate those
robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; cried Zeph delightedly, &#8220;I am helping
you do detective work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Zeph, genuine detective work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! how I wish I had my disguises here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are of more use to me as you are, because
the thieves know you worked for Ames, and they
seem to trust him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Zeph thoughtfully. &#8220;What
you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to locate the thieves,&#8221; responded Ralph.
&#8220;You must know the district about here pretty
well. Can&#8217;t you think of any spot where they
would be likely to hide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None in particular. But I know every foot of
the woods, swamps and creek. If the men you
are looking for are anywhere in the neighborhood,
I am sure we will find a trace of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You pilot the way, then, Zeph. Go with
caution if you find any traces of the men, for I
am sure that at least two of the party know me.&#8221;</p>
<p>For three hours they made a tour of the district,
taking in nearly four miles to the south.
The swamp lands they could not traverse. Finally
they came out of the woods almost directly on a
town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Ralph in some surprise, &#8220;here is
Millville, the next station to Brocton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; nodded Zeph. &#8220;I hardly think
those fellows are in the woods. We have made a
pretty thorough search.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the swamp and the high cliffs we
haven&#8217;t visited,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I suppose you are
hungry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moderately,&#8221; answered Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will go and have something to eat.
I have a friend just on the edge of Millville, who
keeps a very unique restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph smiled pleasantly, for the restaurant in
question was quite a feature with railroad men.</p>
<p>Two lines of railroad crossed at Millville, a
great deal of switching was done outside of the
town, and there was a shanty there to shelter the
men.</p>
<p>A little off from the junction was a very queer-looking
house, if it could be called such. Its main
structure was an old freight car, to which there
had been additions made from time to time.
Across its front was a sign reading, &#8220;Limpy Joe&#8217;s
Railroad Restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever taken a meal here?&#8221; inquired Ralph, as
they approached the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever heard of Limpy Joe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;I am going to introduce
you to the most interesting boy you ever met.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LIMPY JOE&#8217;S RAILROAD RESTAURANT</h3>
</div>
<p>Zeph Dallas stared about him in profound
bewilderment and interest as Ralph led the way
towards Limpy Joe&#8217;s Railroad Restaurant.</p>
<p>It was certainly an odd-appearing place. Additions
had been built onto the freight car until
the same were longer than the original structure.</p>
<p>A square of about two hundred feet was enclosed
by a barbed wire fence, and this space was
quite as interesting as the restaurant building.</p>
<p>There was a rude shack, which seemed to
answer for a barn, a haystack beside it, and a
well-appearing vegetable garden. Then, in one
corner of the yard, was a heap of old lumber,
stone, brick, doors, window sash, in fact, it looked
as if some one had been gathering all the unmated
parts of various houses he could find.</p>
<p>The restaurant was neatly painted a regular,
dark-red freight-car color outside. Into it many
windows had been cut, and a glance through the
open doorway showed an interior scrupulously
neat and clean.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;Limpy Joe&mdash;who
is he? Does he run the place alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;He is an orphan, and
was hurt by the cars a few years ago. The railroad
settled with him for two hundred dollars, an
old freight car and a free pass for life over the
road, including, Limpy Joe stipulated, locomotives
and cabooses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish I had that,&#8221; said Zeph&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;d be riding
all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would soon get tired of it,&#8221; Ralph asserted.
&#8220;Well, Joe invested part of his money in
a horse and wagon, located in that old freight car,
which the company moved here for him from a
wreck in the creek, and became a squatter on that
little patch of ground. Then the restaurant idea
came along, and the railroad hands encouraged
him. Before that, however, Joe had driven all
over the country, picking up old lumber and the
like, and the result is the place as you see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he must be an ambitious, industrious
fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; affirmed Ralph, &#8220;and everybody likes
him. He&#8217;s ready at any time of the night to get
up and give a tired-out railroad hand a hot cup
of coffee or a lunch. His meals are famous, too,
for he is a fine cook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ralph Fairbanks,&#8221; piped a happy little
voice as Ralph and Zeph entered the restaurant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>Ralph shook hands with the speaker, a boy
hobbling about the place on a crutch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it going to be?&#8221; asked Limpy Joe,
&#8220;full dinner or a lunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both, best you&#8217;ve got,&#8221; smiled Ralph. &#8220;The
railroad is paying for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so? Then we&#8217;ll reduce the rates. Railroad
has been too good to me to overcharge the
company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my friend, Zeph Dallas,&#8221; introduced
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to know you,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Sit down at
the counter, fellows, and I&#8217;ll soon have you
served.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Zeph, staring around the
place one way, then the other, and then repeating
the performance. &#8220;This strikes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Interesting to you, is it?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful. Fixed this up all alone out of
odds and ends? I tell you, I&#8217;d like to be a partner
in a business like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want a partner here, Joe?&#8221; called out Ralph
to his friend in a jocular way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a helper,&#8221; answered the cripple, busy
among the shining cooking ware on a kitchen
stove at one end of the restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean that?&#8221; asked Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. I have some new plans I want to carry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
out, and I need some one to attend to the place
half of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Zeph glanced all about the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it fascinates me,&#8221; he observed to Ralph.
&#8220;Upon my word, I believe I&#8217;ll come to work here
when I get through with this work for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what,&#8221; said Limpy Joe with a shrewd
glance at Zeph, as he placed the smoking dishes
before his customers. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it worth the
while of an honest, active fellow to come in here
with me. I have some grand ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had some good ones when you fitted up
the place,&#8221; declared Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it over. I like your looks,&#8221; continued
Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;m in earnest, and I might make it
a partnership after a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys ate a hearty meal, and the young fireman
paid for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business good, Joe?&#8221; he inquired, as they were
about to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Famous. I&#8217;ve got some new customers, too.
Don&#8217;t know who they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, for a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds puzzling,&#8221; observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s considerable of a puzzle to me&mdash;all
except the double pay I get,&#8221; responded Joe. &#8220;For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
nearly a week I&#8217;ve had a funny order. One dark
night some one pushed up a window here and
threw in a card. It contained instructions and a
ten-dollar bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty mysterious,&#8221; said the interested
Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The card told me that if I wanted to continue
a good trade, I would say nothing about it, but
every night at dark drive to a certain point in the
timber yonder with a basket containing a good
solid day&#8217;s feed for half-a-dozen men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; murmured Zeph, while Ralph
gave quite a start, but remained silent, though
strictly attentive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have acted on orders given, and
haven&#8217;t said a word about it to anybody but you,
Ralph. The reason I tell you is, because I think
you are interested in some of the persons who
are buying meals from me in this strange way.
It&#8217;s all right for me to speak out before your
friend here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; assented Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ike Slump is one of the party in the
woods, and Mort Bemis is another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed that the moment you began your
story,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;and I am looking for those
very persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would be interested. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
are wanted for that attempted treasure-train robbery,
aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and for a more recent occurrence,&#8221;
answered Ralph&mdash;&#8220;the looting of the Dover
freight the other night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that, though I should have
done so,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;The way I know that Slump
and Bemis are in the woods yonder, is that one
night I had a breakdown, and was delayed a little,
and saw them come for the food basket where I
had left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s mind was soon made up. He told Joe
all about their plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to help us out, Joe,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean take you up into the woods in the
wagon to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Joe, his shrewd eyes sparkling with
excitement, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it in fine style. Ask no questions.
I&#8217;ve got a plan. I&#8217;ll have another breakdown,
not a sham one, this time. I&#8217;ll have you
two well covered up in the wagon box, and you
can lie there until some one comes after the
basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; approved Ralph, &#8220;you are a genuine
friend, Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph and Zeph had to wait around the restaurant
all the afternoon. There was only an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
occasional customer, and Joe had plenty of time
to spare. He took a rare delight in showing his
friends his treasures, as he called them.</p>
<p>About dusk Joe got the food supply ready for
the party in the woods. He hitched up the horse
to a wagon, arranged some blankets and hay in
the bottom of the vehicle, so that his friends could
hide themselves, and soon all was ready for the
drive into the timber.</p>
<p>Ralph managed to look out as they proceeded
into the woods. The wagon was driven about a
mile. Then Joe got out and set the basket under
a tree.</p>
<p>A little distance from it he got out again, took
off a wheel, left it lying on the ground, unhitched
the horse, and rode away on the back of the
animal. The vehicle, to a casual observer, would
suggest the appearance of a genuine breakdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Zeph,&#8221; said Ralph as both arranged
their coverings so they could view tree and basket
clearly, &#8220;no rash moves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody comes, what then?&#8221; inquired the
farmer boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall follow them, but with great caution.
Keep close to me, so that I can give you special
instructions, if it becomes necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;That will be soon, for
there they are!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Two figures had appeared at the tree. One took
up the basket, the other glanced around stealthily.
Ralph recognized both of them, even in the dim
twilight, at some distance away. One was Ike
Slump, the other his old-time crony and accomplice,
Mort Bemis.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fellow who brought the package
of silk to old Ames,&#8221; whispered Zeph, staring
hard from under covert at Slump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I recognize him,&#8221; responded Ralph in
quite as guarded a tone. &#8220;Quiet, now, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ike Slump and Mort Bemis continued to linger
at the tree. They were looking at the wagon and
beyond it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; spoke the former to his companion,
&#8220;what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How wrong?&#8221; inquired Mort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, some way our plans appear to have
slipped a cog. There&#8217;s the wagon broken down
and the boy has gone with the horse. Two of our
men were to stop him, you know, and keep him
here while we used the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;re behind time. What&#8217;s the matter
with our holding the boy till they come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing,&#8221; responded Ike, and, leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the basket where it was, he and Mort ran after
Limpy Joe and the horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of here, quick,&#8221; ordered Ralph to
Zeph. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t, we shall probably be carried
into the camp of the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just exactly the place that you
want to reach?&#8221; inquired the farmer boy coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in this way. Out with you, and into the
bushes. Don&#8217;t delay, Zeph, drop flat, some one
else is coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a wonder they were not discovered, for
almost immediately two men came running towards
the spot. They were doubtless the persons
Ike Slump had referred to, for they gave a series
of signal whistles, responded to by their youthful
accomplices, who, a minute later, came into view
leading the horse of which Limpy Joe was astride.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were late,&#8221; panted one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should think you were,&#8221; retorted Ike Slump.
&#8220;This boy nearly got away. Say, if you wasn&#8217;t
a cripple,&#8221; he continued to the young restaurant
keeper, &#8220;I&#8217;d give you something for whacking me
with that crutch of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d whack you again, if it would do any good,&#8221;
said the plucky fellow. &#8220;You&#8217;re a nice crowd,
you are, bothering me this way after I&#8217;ve probably
saved you from starvation the last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, sonny,&#8221; drawled out one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the men. &#8220;We paid you for what you&#8217;ve done for
us, and we will pay you still better for simply
coming to our camp and staying there a prisoner,
until we use that rig of yours for a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wanted to borrow the rig, why didn&#8217;t
you do so in a decent fashion?&#8221; demanded Joe
indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep quiet, now,&#8221; advised the man who
carried on the conversation. &#8220;We know our business.
Here, Slump, you and Mort help get this
wheel on the wagon and hitch up the horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>They forced Joe into the wagon bottom and
proceeded to get ready for a drive into the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet Joe is wondering how we came to get out
of that wagon,&#8221; observed Zeph to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Now, when they
start away, I will follow, you remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so that I may find you when I come back,
and so that you can follow the wagon when it
comes out of the woods again if I am not on
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think they are going to move some of
their plunder in the wagon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; replied the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so do I. They won&#8217;t get far with it,
though, if I am after them,&#8221; boasted Zeph.
&#8220;Wish I had a detective star and some weapons.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The safest way to do is to follow them until
they get near a town or settlement, and then go
for assistance and arrest them,&#8221; advised Ralph.
&#8220;Now, then, Zeph, make no false moves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will follow your orders strictly,&#8221;
pledged the farmer boy.</p>
<p>The basket was lifted into the wagon by Ike,
who, with Mort, led the horse through the intricate
timber and brushwood. Progress was
difficult and they proceeded slowly. As soon as
it was safe to do so, Ralph left Zeph. The two
men had taken up the trail of the wagon, guarding
its rear so that Joe could not escape.</p>
<p>Ralph kept sight of them for half-an-hour and
was led deeper and deeper into the woods. These
lined the railroad cut, and he wondered that the
gang of robbers had dared to camp so near to the
recent scene of their thieving operations.</p>
<p>At last the young fireman was following only
two men, for he could no longer see the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they have left Ike and Bemis to go
ahead with the wagon and they are reaching the
camp by a short cut,&#8221; reflected Ralph. &#8220;Why,
no,&#8221; he suddenly exclaimed, as the men turned
aside to take a new path. &#8220;These are not the
same men at all who were with the wagon. I am
off the trail, I am following some one else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph made this discovery with some surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Certainly he had got mixed up in cautiously trailing
the enemy at a distance. He wondered if the
two men he was now following belonged to Ike
Slump&#8217;s crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must assume they do,&#8221; ruminated Ralph, &#8220;at
least for the present. They are bound for some
point in the woods, of course, and I shall soon
know their destination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men proceeded for over a mile. They
commenced an ascent where the cliffs lining the
railroad cut began. The place was thick with
underbrush and quite rocky in places, wild and
desolate in the extreme, and the path they pursued
so tortuous and winding that Ralph at length lost
sight of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have they disappeared to?&#8221; he asked
himself, bending his ear, keeping a sharp lookout,
and with difficulty penetrating the worst jungle
of bushes and stunted trees he had yet encountered.
&#8220;I hear voices.&#8221;</p>
<p>These guided Ralph, and he followed their indication.
At last he came to a halt near an open
space, where the men he was following had
stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are, Ames,&#8221; were the first distinct
words that Ralph heard spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, one of these men must be the farmer
that Zeph worked for,&#8221; decided Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you&#8217;re safe enough up here. Got
the plunder here, have you?&#8221; was asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I will show you the exact spot, and you
come here after we have got the bulk of the stuff
to a new hiding place, take it as you can, dispose
of it, and keep us in ready money until we feel
safe to ship our goods to some distant city and
realize on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do just that,&#8221; was replied. &#8220;What are
you leaving here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adair, the road detective, is after us, we
understand, and this is too dangerously near the
railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; replied the person Ralph supposed
to be Ames. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll not miss on my end
of the case. Only, don&#8217;t send any more packages
of the silk to friends. The one Slump sent might
have got you into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew he did it at the time,&#8221; was responded.
&#8220;I raised a big row when I found out.
You see, Evans, the man he sent it to, is in with
us in a way, and is a particular friend of Ike
Slump, but it was a big risk to send him goods
that might be traced right back to us. Safe hiding
place, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker had proceeded to some bushes
guarding the entrance to a cave-like depression in
the dirt, gravel and rocks. He re-appeared with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
some packages for his companion. Then both
went away from the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Ralph, with considerable satisfaction,
&#8220;this is the hiding place of the plunder. I
am in possession, and what am I going to do
about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The discovery had come about so easily that
the young fireman could scarcely plan out a next
intelligent move all in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ames is an accomplice of the thieves,&#8221; he
decided, &#8220;who are going to use Joe&#8217;s wagon to
remove the bulk of this plunder. They will soon
be here. What had I better do&mdash;what can I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went in among the bushes as the men
had done. He took a glance at a great heap of
packages lying in a depression in the rocks. Then
he advanced a few steps towards the edge of the
cliff.</p>
<p>Ralph looked down fully two hundred feet into
the railroad cut. This was almost the spot where
the landslide had stopped the Dover night freight.
The main tracks were clear now, but on a gravel
pit siding were several cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Ralph suddenly, &#8220;if I only
have the time to do it in, I have got the whole
affair right in my own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>A plan to deprive the railroad thieves of their
booty had come into the mind of the young fireman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Ralph filled his arms with the packages of
silk, advanced to the edge of the cliff, threw them
over, and continued his operation until he had removed
the last parcel from its hiding place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something more to do yet,&#8221; he told himself,
when this task was completed. &#8220;When the thieves
discover that their plunder is gone, they may
surmise that it disappeared this way. Can I make
a safe descent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had a hard time getting down into the
railroad cut. Once there, he hastily threw the silk
packages into a half-filled gravel car, with a
shovel covered them all over with sand and
gravel, and then started on a run for Brocton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A SUSPICIOUS PROCEEDING</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Griscom, this is life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks spoke with all the ardor of a
lively, ambitious boy in love with the work in
hand. He sat in the cab of the locomotive that
drew the Limited Mail, and he almost felt as if
he owned the splendid engine, the finest in the
service of the Great Northern.</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed by since the young fireman
had baffled the railroad thieves. Ralph had
made brief work of his special duty for Adair, the
road detective, and there had come to him a reward
for doing his duty that was beyond his fondest
expectations. This was a promotion that most
beginners in his line would not have earned in any
such brief space of time. The recovery of the
stolen silk, however, had made Bob Adair a better
friend than ever. The road detective had influence,
and Ralph was promoted to the proud position
of fireman of the Limited Mail.</p>
<p>This was his first trip in the passenger service,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and naturally Ralph was anxious and excited.
Griscom had been made engineer, his eyes having
mended, and Ralph was very glad that the veteran
railroader would continue as his partner.</p>
<p>Regarding the silk robbery, that was now ancient
history, but for several days the occurrence
had been one of interest all along the line. Adair
had made public the circumstances of the case,
and Ralph became quite a hero.</p>
<p>The night he had managed to get the plunder
into the gravel car he had instantly secured assistance
at Brocton. The valuable goods were
guarded all night, and a party of men made a
search for the thieves, but they had taken the
alarm and had escaped.</p>
<p>Zeph Dallas had gone back to Millville with
Limpy Joe, and went to work there. A further
search was made for Ike Slump, Mort Bemis and
their accomplices, but they could not be found.
Jim Evans had been discharged from the railroad
service. Nothing more was heard of Gasper Farrington,
and it seemed to Ralph as if at last his
enemies had been fully routed and there was nothing
but a clear track ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels as if I was beginning life all over
again,&#8221; Ralph had told his mother that morning.
&#8220;Fireman of the Limited Mail&mdash;just think of it,
mother! one of the best positions on the road.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>Ralph decided that the position demanded very
honorable treatment, and he looked neat and quite
dressed up, even in his working clothes, as he
now sat in the engine cab.</p>
<p>Griscom proceeded to give him lots of suggestions
and information regarding his new duties.</p>
<p>There had been a change in the old time
schedule of the Limited Mail. Originally it had
started from the city terminus in the early morning.
Now the run was reversed, and the train
left Stanley Junction at 10:15 A.M.</p>
<p>Ralph proceeded to get everything in order for
the prospective run, but everything was so handy,
it was a pleasure to contemplate his duties.</p>
<p>Just before train time a boy came running up
to the engine. He was an old schoolmate and a
neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph! Ralph!&#8221; he called breathlessly to the
young fireman. &#8220;Your mother sent me with a
letter that she got at the post-office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me? Thank you, Ned,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>He glanced at the address. The handwriting
was unfamiliar. There was no time left to inspect
the enclosure, so Ralph slipped the letter in his
pocket and proceeded to attend to the fire.</p>
<p>He quite forgot the letter after that, finding
the duties of a first-class fireman to be extremely
arduous. There was plenty of coal to shovel, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
he was pretty well tired out when they reached
the city terminus.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, lad,&#8221; said Griscom proudly, as they
steamed into the depot on time to a second. &#8220;This
makes me feel like old times once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a wait of four hours in the city,
during which period the train hands were at liberty
to spend their time as they chose. Griscom
took Ralph to a neat little hotel, where they had
a meal and the privileges of a reading room. It
was there that Ralph suddenly remembered the
letter sent to him that morning by his mother.</p>
<p>As he opened it he was somewhat puzzled, for
the signature was strange to him. The missive
stated that the writer &#8220;was acting for a former
resident of Stanley Junction who wished to settle
up certain obligations, if a satisfactory arrangement
could be made.&#8221; Further the writer, as
agent of the party in question, would meet Ralph
at a certain hotel at a certain time and impart to
him his instructions.</p>
<p>The young fireman was about to consult Griscom
as to this mysterious missive, but found the
old engineer engaged in conversation with some
fellow railroaders, and, leaving the place, he proceeded
to the hotel named in the letter.</p>
<p>He was an hour ahead of the time appointed in
the communication and waited patiently for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
developments, thinking a good deal and wondering
what would come of the affair.</p>
<p>Finally a man came into the place, acting as if
he was looking for somebody. He was an under-sized
person with a mean and crafty face. He
glanced at Ralph, hesitated somewhat, and then
advanced towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your name Fairbanks?&#8221; he questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrote you a letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I received one, yes,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;May I ask
its meaning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is nothing gained by beating about
the bush. I represent, as an attorney, Mr. Gasper
Farrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that when I read your letter,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we understand each other,&#8221; pursued the
attorney. &#8220;Now then, see here, Farrington wants
to do the square thing by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;He owes
us twenty thousand dollars and he has got to pay
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can undoubtedly collect it in
time,&#8221; admitted the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why all this mystery?&#8221; asked Ralph
abruptly. &#8220;In an important matter like this, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
appears to me some regular attorney might consult
our attorneys at Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farrington won&#8217;t do that. He don&#8217;t feel the
kindest in the world towards your people. Here
is his simple proposition: This affair is to be
settled up quietly between the parties directly interested.
I am to give you certain papers for
your mother to sign. You get them attended to.
You will be later advised where and when to deliver
them and get your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty thousand dollars?&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph did not like the looks of things, but he
kept his own counsel, and simply said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, give me the documents you speak
of and I will act upon them as my mother decides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And keep the business strictly to yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>This looked reasonable to Ralph. He knew
that Farrington felt deeply the disgrace already
attached to his name for past misdeeds of which
he had been guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no desire to humiliate Mr. Farrington
any further,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We simply insist upon
our rights. This strikes me as a mysterious and
uncalled-for method of settling up a claim purely
business-like in its character.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way of old Farrington, you know,&#8221;
suggested the man, with a coarse laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he seems to be given to dark ways,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it is all arranged?&#8221; questioned the &#8220;lawyer&#8221;
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as it can be arranged for the time being.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, you shall hear from us in a few
days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph left the hotel with one fixed conviction
in his mind&mdash;that old Gasper Farrington was up
to some new scheme and that it would be wise to
look out for him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE SPECIAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Within a week the young fireman of the
Limited Mail was in full swing as a trusted and
valued employe of the Great Northern. Engineer
Griscom had got the time schedule down to a
system of which he was proud. They made successful
runs without a break or accident, and
Ralph loved the life for its variety, experience
and promise of sure promotion.</p>
<p>The documents given to him for his mother by
the agent of Gasper Farrington in the city were
apparently all regular and business-like. They
covered receipt for twenty thousand dollars, designating
certain numbered bonds indicated, but one
phrase which exonerated the village magnate
from blame or crooked dealing in the affair Ralph
did not at all like. He believed that there was
some specious scheme under this matter and he
awaited developments.</p>
<p>One blustering night he and Griscom had just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
run the engine into the roundhouse, when Tim
Forgan, the foreman, came hastening towards
them, a paper fluttering in his hand and accompanied
by a young fellow about twenty years of
age. The latter was handsome and manly-looking,
very well dressed, and Ralph liked him on sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very men,&#8221; spoke Forgan, showing an
unusual excitement of manner. &#8220;Griscom, Fairbanks,
let me introduce you to Mr. Trevor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Engineer and fireman bowed, but the young
man insisted on shaking hands cordially with his
new acquaintances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, gentlemen,&#8221; he said briskly.
&#8220;I have heard nothing but regrets as to your absence
and praises for your ability in the railroad
line from Forgan here. Tell your story, Mr. Forgan.
You know time is money to me, just at
present,&#8221; and the speaker consulted an elegant
timepiece in a hurried, anxious way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s just this,&#8221; said Forgan. &#8220;Mr.
Trevor, who is a nephew of the president of the
road, came to me with a telegram directing us to
send him through to the city on the quickest time
on record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A special, eh?&#8221; said Griscom, eyeing the
young man speculatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;About that, only there is no time to waste in
making up a train, and he inclines to riding on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
the locomotive. The train dispatcher will give
clear tracks to terminus. We were just picking
out an engine when you arrived. How is it,
Griscom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, will we undertake the job?&#8221; inquired
the veteran engineer in his practical,
matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; nodded Trevor eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a hard double run?&#8221; insinuated
Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; it isn&#8217;t right to ask them, Forgan.
Give me some other engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you wait till I answer?&#8221; demanded
Griscom. &#8220;Yes, we will, and glad to show you
the courtesy. Is that right, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Ralph. &#8220;Is it a matter of
a great deal of urgency, Mr. Trevor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Particularly so. I have come five hundred
miles on other roads on specials. I must connect
with a train in the city at a certain time, or I miss
Europe and important business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Griscom took out his greasy, well-worn
train schedule. He looked it over and pointing
to the regular time made, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We can discount that exactly seventy-two
minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that will bring me to terminus exactly on
time,&#8221; said the young man brightly. &#8220;Do it, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
friends, and you shall have a hundred dollars between
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t at all necessary&#8221;&mdash;began Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, but in this case it is,&#8221; broke in
Trevor. &#8220;It&#8217;s all arranged. Thanks. I will put
on a rain coat, and if you will stow me in some
corner of the tender I shall enjoy the run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forgan bustled about. Through the call boy
of the roundhouse Ralph sent word to his mother
of the extra trip. Then he worked like a beaver
on the locomotive. Trevor watched him in a
pleased and admiring way.</p>
<p>They ran the locomotive out on the turn table.
Griscom consulted his watch, talked a few
moments with Forgan, and said to Ralph:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tracks clear in twelve minutes, lad. Just
time enough to get a bite at the nearest restaurant.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they returned, Trevor stood near the
engine glancing all around him in a very animated
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for Forgan?&#8221; inquired the old engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I was wondering where a fellow
disappeared to who was hanging around the
tender a few minutes ago. He and a companion
have been following me ever since I arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they have given up the job,&#8221; observed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Griscom, glancing keenly about. &#8220;Why should
they follow you, Mr. Trevor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I cannot tell. Probably thought I
looked prosperous, and were bent on waylaying
me. Anyhow, they kept close to me down the
tracks from the depot. Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In precisely one minute. There is the Dover
Accommodation now,&#8221; announced the engineer,
as a headlight came around a curve. &#8220;All right.
We&#8217;ll have to coal up at the limits. Then we will
make you a comfortable seat, Mr. Trevor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you give yourselves any concern about
me,&#8221; replied Trevor. &#8220;I am used to railroad life.&#8221;</p>
<p>They coaled up at the limits, but did not stop
for water, the tank being three-quarters full.
Ralph made tests of air valve and water pump,
shook down the furnace, and the locomotive
quivered under high-steam pressure as they
started on their special run.</p>
<p>A flagman shouted something at them as they
passed a switch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was he saying?&#8221; inquired Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hear him,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought he pointed at the engine&mdash;at the cow-catcher,&#8221;
remarked Trevor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything all right there,&#8221; assured Ralph,
and in the brisk action of the hour the circumstance
was forgotten.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>Twenty, thirty, forty miles made, and as they
slowed down Griscom turned to Trevor, a proud
glitter in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that, sir?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Famous!&#8221; cried the young man cheerily.
&#8220;Badly shaken up, and this seat up here is rather
bumpy, but I enjoy it, just the same. Going to
stop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, crossing. Only for half-a-minute,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine halted on regular signal. Griscom
got down and ran about a bit, explaining that he
was subject to cramps when seated long in one
position. Two men came up to the locomotive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give us a lift?&#8221; demanded one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t do it, partner,&#8221; responded Ralph.
&#8220;Under special orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of room up there on the tender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for you,&#8221; answered the young fireman.</p>
<p>Both men regarded Trevor very keenly. Then
they disappeared in the darkness. Ralph got the
signal from the crossing&#8217;s switch tower to go
ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Griscom,&#8221; he called out from his window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where is he?&mdash;I don&#8217;t see him,&#8221; said
Trevor in surprise. &#8220;I saw him out there not a
minute ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph jumped to the ground in amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Nowhere in sight was Griscom; nowhere within
hearing either, it seemed. Like the two rough
fellows who had just approached the engine, Griscom
has disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is mysterious,&#8221; declared the young
fireman in an anxious tone of concern. &#8220;Where
can he have disappeared to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of things,&#8221; spoke Trevor.
&#8220;Something is wrong, Fairbanks,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Look ahead there&mdash;I just saw a man on the cowcatcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Ralph was more than mystified, he was
alarmed. He seized a rod and jumped again to the
ground. Sure enough, on the cowcatcher sat a
man, huddled up comfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; demanded Ralph, keeping his
distance and eyeing the intruder suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me a tramp, if you like,&#8221; laughed the
fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must get off of that cowcatcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do&mdash;against the rules. Come, move on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You try to put me off, youngster,&#8221; drawled
the fellow, with an ugly look in his eyes, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
use this,&#8221; and he drew a revolver from his pocket.
&#8220;I want a free ride, and I intend to have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you make me stop at the tower to get
you put off?&#8221; threatened Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no one there but the
towerman, and he can&#8217;t leave duty, and you won&#8217;t
stop because you&#8217;re on a fast run. Take it easy,
sonny. I don&#8217;t weigh much, and I won&#8217;t hurt
your old locomotive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph could do nothing better than submit to
the imposition for the time being. He returned
to the cab. His face was quite anxious. He
called again to Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What can
have befallen him? Keep a close watch here for
a few minutes, will you?&#8221; he asked of his passenger.</p>
<p>Ralph took a lantern and ran down the tracks,
flashed the light across the empty freights lining
the tracks, and returned to the locomotive more
anxious than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think what to do, Mr. Trevor,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>The young man consulted his watch nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you, Fairbanks, we mustn&#8217;t lose time.
You can&#8217;t find your partner. Run to the tower
and have the man there telegraph the circumstances
and get someone to look for Griscom.
We will have to run on without him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without Griscom!&#8221; cried Ralph. &#8220;Why, we
cannot possibly secure a substitute this side of
Dover.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need one&mdash;you know how to run an
engine, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a fashion, probably, but I am worried about
Mr. Griscom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The towerman can attend to that. I don&#8217;t
want to appear selfish, Fairbanks, but you must
get this special through on time or get to some
point where we can find another engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Without a fireman,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that department,&#8221; said Trevor,
briskly throwing off his coat. &#8220;Now then, the
tower, your word to the operator there, and make
up for lost time, Fairbanks, if you want to earn
that hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>KIDNAPPED</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph climbed to the engineer&#8217;s seat with
many misgivings and very anxious concerning his
missing partner. He knew how to run an engine,
for the young fireman had watched Griscom at his
duties, had studied every separate piece of machinery
thoroughly, and more than once had relieved
the veteran engineer for brief periods of
time between stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all well enough on a regular run,&#8221;
thought Ralph, &#8220;but a special is a different thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, coming to the switch tower, he called
up to the operator there, who was at the open
window. He explained hurriedly about the disappearance
of Griscom. He also asked the towerman
to telegraph ahead to Dover for a substitute
engineer. The operator said he would have some
men come down from the first station back on the
route on a handcar to search for the missing rail-roader.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Man on your cowcatcher there,&#8221; he called
down as Ralph started up the engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;No time to bother with him now. Let him
ride to Dover, if he wants to,&#8221; advised Trevor.
&#8220;Now, Fairbanks, you to the throttle, me to the
furnace. Just give me a word of direction when
I need it, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>But for his anxiety concerning his missing partner,
the young fireman would have enjoyed the
run of the next two hours immensely. There was
a clear track&mdash;he had only to look out for signals.
He was entirely familiar with the route, and
Trevor proved a capable, practical assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look much like the man who left a
palace car to step into a locomotive at Stanley
Junction, eh?&#8221; laughed the young man, reeking
with perspiration, and greasy and grimed.
&#8220;How do I do&mdash;all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have had experience in the fireman
line,&#8221; submitted Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; acknowledged Trevor. &#8220;My uncle
made me work in a roundhouse for a year. Once
I believe I could run an engine, but I&#8217;ve forgotten
a good deal. Fairbanks, look ahead!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no occasion for the warning. Already
the young fireman had discovered what his
companion announced. As the locomotive glided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
around a sharp curve a great glare confronted
them.</p>
<p>Not two hundred yards ahead was a mass of
flames shooting skywards. The bridge crossing
a creek that was located at this part of the route
was on fire.</p>
<p>Ralph started to slow down. Then, discerning
the impossibility of doing so this side of the burning
structure, he set full speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s make or break,&#8221; he said, in a kind of
gasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put her through&mdash;take the risk,&#8221; ordered
Trevor sharply.</p>
<p>Swish! crackle! crash!&mdash;it was an eventful
moment in the career of the young fireman. There
was a blinding glow, a rain of fire swayed
through the locomotive cab, then, just as they
cleared the bridge, the structure went down to
midstream.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get this news to Dover quick,&#8221; said
Ralph, applying himself anew to lever and
throttle. &#8220;We have ten minutes to make up
then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clink!&mdash;snap!&mdash;a terrific jar shook the locomotive.
Contrary to signal given at the nearest
switch ahead, the engine veered to a siding.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; demanded Trevor
sharply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mischief&mdash;malice, perhaps,&#8221; said Ralph quickly.
&#8220;Freights ahead&mdash;we shall have to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it,&#8221; directed Trevor. &#8220;Drive into
them and push them ahead to the main line again.
I&#8217;ll stand all damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are empties, I noticed them on the afternoon
run,&#8221; said the young fireman. &#8220;Mr. Trevor,
all this complication, all these happenings are
suspicious. We will have to slow down to the
freights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow down entirely,&#8221; growled a sudden voice.
&#8220;Do it, or I&#8217;ll have it done by my partner, who is
aboard all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Ralph and Trevor turned sharply. Standing
on the coal of the tender was a man. He was
dripping with water, and in one hand held a
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;No delay, Fairbanks,&#8221; he cautioned sternly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken too much trouble to miss this last
chance to get you and your passenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph stopped the engine. Then calmly, but
with a certain sense of peril and defeat, he faced
the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; demanded
Trevor in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only from inside the water tank,&#8221; responded
the stranger coolly. &#8220;Been there since we left
Stanley Junction.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are one of the fellows who were
following me at the depot!&#8221; cried Trevor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct, boss,&#8221; chuckled the stranger. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
my partner,&#8221; he announced, as the man Ralph
had discovered on the cowcatcher appeared at the
side of the cab. &#8220;We&#8217;ll relieve you two now,&#8221;
continued the speaker to Ralph and Trevor.
&#8220;Move back on that coal. We&#8217;ll try a bit of engineering
ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my man,&#8221; called out Trevor sharply.
&#8220;What is the object of all this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Object?&#8221; grinned the man. &#8220;You&#8217;ll know
later. Important, for it took four men on the
route, lots of inquiring before you came to Stanley
Junction, two of us here now, others waiting
for us somewhere else, to get you dead right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; exclaimed Trevor in amazement. &#8220;You
mean me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, how are you interested in me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back, do as we say, or we&#8217;ll use force,&#8221;
declared the speaker gruffly.</p>
<p>His companion guarded Ralph and Trevor
while he took the engineer&#8217;s seat. He reversed
the engine, ran back to the main tracks, from
there, first setting a switch, onto a spur, and, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
following this for nearly a mile, shut off steam
and the locomotive came to a stop.</p>
<p>Then the fellow applied a whistle to his lips.
Several men approached the engine. He consulted
with them, and came back to Ralph carrying
a piece of rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to tie you
for safe keeping for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you explain this?&#8221; inquired Trevor, in
a troubled way. &#8220;See here, men, I am due in the
city. I will pay you handsomely to let us proceed
on our trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; inquired the man who had acted
as engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have several hundred dollars with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough,&#8221; retorted the man. &#8220;We want
several thousand, seeing you are worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a thousand dollars in the world,&#8221;
declared Trevor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are worth twenty thousand,&#8221; insisted the
man confidently. &#8220;We&#8217;ll prove it to you a little
later. Here,&#8221; to his companion, &#8220;tie Fairbanks,
leave the letter with him, and let us get out of this
before anybody is missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One word,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Are you people responsible
for the disappearance of Mr. Griscom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;He&#8217;s all safe and
sound&mdash;only out of the way of mischief for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
spell. One other word, Fairbanks, we didn&#8217;t fire
the bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevor looked the picture of distress and uncertainty
as he was forced from the locomotive
cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;You people will regret this high-handed outrage,&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;My uncle is president of the
Great Northern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just exactly why you are worth twenty
thousand dollars,&#8221; coolly announced the man who
had acted as engineer. &#8220;Plain and square, gentlemen,
kindly call this a bit of kidnapping scientifically
worked at some care and expense. You
come with us. Fairbanks will do the rest. Got
him tied up?&#8221; to his companion. &#8220;All right, now
put the letter in his pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, leaving the young fireman bound and
helpless on the floor of the cab, the men with
Trevor left the scene.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE RAILROAD PRESIDENT</h3>
</div>
<p>The young fireman had a good deal to think
of as he lay in the locomotive cab, unable to help
himself in any way. All the smooth sailing of
the past week was remembered in strong contrast
to the anxieties of the present moment.</p>
<p>Ralph had not recognized any of the crowd
who had appeared about the engine during the
evening. The leader, however, seemed to know
his name. This inclined Ralph to the belief that
some one of the party did know him, and naturally
he thought of Ike Slump and his associates.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are desperate men, whoever they are,&#8221;
he decided, &#8220;and they must have planned out this
scheme to perfection to keep track of Mr. Trevor
and follow us up along the line. That man in
the water tank is a daring fellow. He must have
had a pleasant time in there. It was an original
move, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in vain that Ralph endeavored to release
himself. He was stoutly tied. All he could do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
was to wriggle about and wonder how soon he
would be set free by his captors or discovered by
others.</p>
<p>It must have been fully three hours before there
was any break in the monotony of his situation.
Ralph heard some one whistling a tune and
approaching rapidly. Soon a man appeared on
the cab step, looked Ralph over coolly, and observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tired of waiting for me, kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; responded Ralph. &#8220;Are you going
to set me free?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the orders, seeing that our party is safe
at a distance. Got enough steam on to run the
engine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Ralph. &#8220;There was full pressure
when you people stopped us, and the steam
lasts about six hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You will have a great story to tell
the railroad folks, eh? Don&#8217;t forget the letter we
put in your pocket. There you are. Now then,
go about your business and don&#8217;t say we did not
treat you like a gentleman. Oh&mdash;ooh! What&#8217;s
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had cut the ropes that held Ralph
captive, and carelessly swung to the step. In a
flash the young fireman was on his mettle.
Springing to his feet, Ralph snatched at a hooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
rod. Reaching out, he caught the man by the
coat collar and pulled him back flat across the cab
floor where he had just lain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie still, or I shall use harsh measures,&#8221;
declared Ralph, springing upon his captive and
menacing him with the rod. &#8220;Hold up your
hands, folded, and let me tie you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall!&#8221; cried Ralph.</p>
<p>In a second the situation changed. The man
was much stronger than his opponent. He managed
to throw Ralph off, and got to his knees.
The young fireman decided, as the fellow reached
for a weapon, to strike out with the iron rod. It
landed heavily on the man&#8217;s temple, and he fell
back senseless on the coal of the tender with a
groan.</p>
<p>Ralph securely tied his captive. Then he reversed
the lever and opened the throttle. In a
minute he was speeding back over the spur the
way the locomotive had come four hours previous.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have one of the kidnappers, at least,&#8221; he
said with satisfaction. &#8220;Ah, there is some one at
the bridge,&#8221; he added, as he ran down the main
tracks.</p>
<p>Signals of danger were set on both sides of the
creek, and Ralph could make out men in the distance
moving about. He was soon on the scene.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>A track-walker had discovered the burning
bridge and had summoned assistance.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do with the locomotive,
to run on to Dover, and this Ralph did at
once. He reported the occurrences of the evening
to the assistant superintendent, whom he
found getting a wrecking crew together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a serious and amazing piece of
business,&#8221; commented that official. &#8220;Here, men,&#8221;
he called to his assistants on the wrecking car,
&#8220;fetch this fellow into the shanty yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man Ralph had knocked down in the locomotive
cab had recovered consciousness. He was
brought into the shanty and questioned, but was
sullen and silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t tell anything, eh?&#8221; said the assistant
superintendent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The letter says all there is to say,&#8221; remarked
the captive coolly, &#8220;but that twenty thousand
dollars will never find young Trevor if you keep
me a prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A prisoner safe and tight you shall be,&#8221; declared
the railroad official with determination.
&#8220;Take him to the town jail, men,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I
must wire for the president of the road at once,
and to Adair at Stanley Junction. What&#8217;s your
plan, Fairbanks?&#8221; he asked of Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know,&#8221; responded the young fireman.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that I can be of any assistance here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter the kidnappers had left with Ralph
was terse and clear as to its directions. The
writer demanded twenty thousand dollars for the
return of young Trevor, and indicated how his
friends might get in correspondence with his
captors through an advertisement in the city
newspapers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wrecking car is going to the bridge, Fairbanks,&#8221;
said the official. &#8220;You can cross the
creek some way and use a handcar, if they have
one. Tell the men there I say so. As to your
prisoner, I will see that he is taken care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was just daylight when Ralph reached the
switch tower where Griscom had disappeared.
The towerman had just been relieved from duty,
and met Ralph with eager welcome as he was
approaching the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We just found
Griscom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; inquired Ralph quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the tower, all safe and comfortable now,
but he had a hard time of it lying all night in a
freight car, gagged and tied. He is fighting mad,
don&#8217;t understand the affair, and worried to death
about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am all right,&#8221; said Ralph.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are. But what has happened, anyhow?
You&#8217;ll want to tell Griscom, won&#8217;t you?
Well, I&#8217;ll go back with you to hear your story,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an interesting scene, the meeting of the
engineer and the young fireman. Griscom fretted
and fumed over the mishaps to his pet locomotive.
He was furious at the gang who had worked out
such mischief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wire my resignation when we reach Stanley
Junction,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do no more railroad
work until I find those scoundrels and rescue
young Trevor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be rash, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; advised Ralph.
&#8220;The railroad detective force will soon be on the
trail. The nephew of a railroad president doesn&#8217;t
disappear in this fashion every day in the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they got back to Stanley Junction they
were interviewed at once by Bob Adair. Both
were worn out with double duty and got to bed as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Ralph reported at the roundhouse late in the
afternoon, but learned that there would be no
through trains out until a temporary bridge was
erected over the creek near Dover.</p>
<p>He returned to the house, and was pleased with
the thought of having a social evening at home
and a good night&#8217;s rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>It was shortly after dark, and Ralph was reading
a book in the cozy sitting room of the home
cottage, when the door bell rang.</p>
<p>The young fireman answered the summons. A
stranger stood at the threshold. He was a dignified,
well-dressed gentleman, but seemed to be
laboring under some severe mental strain, for he
acted nervous and agitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fairbanks&mdash;Ralph Fairbanks?&#8221; he inquired
in a tone of voice that quivered slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very anxious to have a talk with you,&#8221;
said the stranger hurriedly. &#8220;I have been down
the line, and have just arrived at Stanley Junction.
My name is Grant, Robert Grant, and I am the
president of the Great Northern Railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, sir,&#8221; said Ralph cordially, deeply
impressed with welcoming so important a visitor,
but maintaining his usual manly pose. He
showed the official into the house and introduced
him to his mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant was soon in the midst of his story.
He had been for many hours at Dover trying to
discover a trace of his missing nephew, and had
signally failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Adair, the road detective, advised me to
see you,&#8221; said Mr. Grant, &#8220;for you saw the men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
who captured my nephew. Would you know
them again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of them,&#8221; responded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then. I ask you as a special favor
to return with me to Dover and assist me in my
task.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do so gladly,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>One hour later a special conveyed the president
of the Great Northern and Ralph Fairbanks down
the line to Dover.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SHORT LINE RAILWAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph attracted a good deal of attention when
he arrived at Dover, and fully realized the honor
of being treated as a companion by the president
of the great railroad of which he was an employe.
Mr. Grant was pleasant and friendly.
He learned Ralph&#8217;s story, and discussed railroad
experience in a way that was enlightening and
encouraging to the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;About these kidnappers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I will never
give them a dollar, but I will spend all I have to
rescue my nephew. It is needless to say that you
shall be richly rewarded if you assist me successfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do my best, sir,&#8221; pledged Ralph.</p>
<p>At Dover they were met by Adair. They went
into the depot and sat down on a bench in a remote
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not discovered the kidnappers nor the
faintest clew to them, Mr. Grant,&#8221; said Adair.</p>
<p>The railroad president sighed deeply. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
showed in his face and manner the care and
anxiety he was suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you suggest anything, Fairbanks?&#8221; continued
Adair. &#8220;You know the district fairly well.
What is your idea about these men?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph astonished his companions by suddenly
arising to his feet and hurrying towards a boy
who had just entered the depot and had taken up
a pen and a telegraph pad on the counter outside
the ticket office.</p>
<p>It was Van Sherwin, the old-time friend of
Ralph, and pleasure at recognizing him had
caused the young fireman to act on an impulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Van!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I am glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; spoke the other. &#8220;Ralph! well, the gladness
is mutual,&#8221; and the pair shook hands cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you here?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Came down from headquarters in the timber
on important business,&#8221; replied Van. &#8220;Just sending
a telegram.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; almost shouted Ralph, glancing at the
blank upon which his friend had just written a
name, &#8220;to Mr. Grant, to the president of the
Great Northern!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Van. &#8220;Does that startle
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does. What are you wiring him for?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About his nephew, Dudley Trevor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was fairly taken off his feet, as the saying
goes. He grasped Van&#8217;s arm excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Van Sherwin,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;What
do you know of Mr. Trevor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that he is at our headquarters with a
broken arm, and he sent me here to wire his uncle
the fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was delighted. He could scarcely credit
the glad news. He led Van up to the railroad
president and the road detective with the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I am very happy to tell you that
Mr. Trevor is in safe hands, and my friend here
will explain. Van Sherwin, this is Mr. Grant,
the president of the Great Northern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Van nodded in his crisp, off-hand way to Adair,
whom he knew, and took off his cap to his dignified
companion.</p>
<p>His story was to his auditors most remarkable
and exciting, but to Van only the narration of a
perfectly natural occurrence. Early that morning
there had come into &#8220;headquarters,&#8221; as Van
termed it, a young man in an almost exhausted
condition. His attire was all torn with brambles
and bushes and one arm was broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told us his name, and said that he had
escaped from kidnappers. Mr. Gibson attended to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
his arm, and sent me to Dover here to telegraph
to you, sir,&#8221; explained Van to the railroad president.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant was so glad and excited he could not
sit still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me to him at once!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;My dear
lad, you have brought happy news to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about going to see him,&#8221; said
Van. &#8220;It is over twenty miles away in the
woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allow me to explain, Mr. Grant,&#8221; said Adair.
&#8220;Between here and Wilmer is a wild, wooded
stretch of land known as The Barrens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of it,&#8221; nodded Mr. Grant. &#8220;The Great
Northern once surveyed two miles into the section,
but abandoned the route as impracticable. There
are only about twenty houses in the district, and
the difficulties of clearing and grading were discouraging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Adair, &#8220;it appears that a man
named Farwell Gibson secured a charter to build
a short line through The Barrens from Wilmer
across the desolate tract to connect with the Midland
Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard of that, too,&#8221; nodded the railroad
president.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Gibson is an odd genius. He has been
working for two years on his scheme, terming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the road the Dover &amp; Springfield Short Line.
Just half way across The Barrens he has a house,
which he calls &#8216;headquarters.&#8217; He is an erratic
hermit, and adopted this boy here, Van Sherwin,
who has been helping him. Every day, the law
requires, he must do some grading work on the
prospective railroad line. This he has done, and
you would be surprised to know the progress they
have made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially lately,&#8221; said Van, with sparkling
eyes. &#8220;Even you, Ralph, would be astonished.
Mrs. Gibson got some money recently&mdash;five
thousand dollars from old Gasper Farrington&mdash;and
we have hired a lot of men. Oh, that railroad
is going through, and don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized our mistake after this Gibson got
hold of the franchise,&#8221; said Mr. Grant. &#8220;Once
the road is built, it practically dominates passenger
and freight business north and south.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; said Van, &#8220;for it becomes a
bee-line, saving twenty to thirty miles distance,
besides opening up a new district. Well, sir, your
nephew is now at our headquarters. To reach
the place you will have to get a very heavy wagon
and go pretty slow and sure, for there are no
roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go at all hazards,&#8221; cried the railroad
president insistently, &#8220;and you, my friends, must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
accompany me,&#8221; he added to Adair and Ralph.
&#8220;Why, those villains from whom my nephew
escaped may undertake to recapture him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later the party, in charge of a sturdy
fellow driving a strong team of horses attached
to a heavy wagon, started out under the direction
of Van Sherwin.</p>
<p>The district was a wild jungle, interspersed
with sweeps of hill and dales, and numerous
creeks. Finally they reached a hill surmounted
by a dense grove of trees. A road led up here to
a rambling log house.</p>
<p>Here and on the other side of the hill a ten-foot
avenue was visible, neat and clean. The
brush had been cleared away, the ground leveled,
here and there some rudely cut ties set in place,
and for an extended stretch there was a presentable
graded roadbed.</p>
<p>As they drove up to the cabin the railroad president
almost forgot his nephew from interest in his
surroundings. Across the front of the building
was a sign reading: &#8220;Headquarters of the Dover
&amp; Springfield Short Line Railroad.&#8221; To the
south there was a singular sight presented. Some
twenty men and boys were working on a roadbed,
which had been cut for over two miles. A telegraph
wire ran from the building over the tops
of trees, and Ralph was fairly astonished at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
progress made since he had first visited Farwell
Gibson in this place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Van, as Mr. Grant alighted
from the wagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is decidedly a railroady place,&#8221; observed
the president of the Great Northern with a
faint smile.</p>
<p>One half of the rambling place was a depot and
railway offices combined. There were benches for
passengers. In one corner was a partitioned off
space, labeled: &#8220;President&#8217;s Office.&#8221; On the wall
hung a bunch of blank baggage checks, and there
was a chart of a zigzag railway line, indicating
bridges, water tanks and switch towers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Gibson,&#8221; called out Van to a man seated
at a desk, &#8220;this is Mr. Grant, the president of the
Great Northern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? what! My dear sir, I am glad to see
you,&#8221; said the eccentric hermit. &#8220;You came about
your nephew, I presume? Take the gentleman to
his room, Van,&#8221; directed Farwell. &#8220;I am something
of a doctor and he is resting quite comfortably.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Gibson greeted Ralph very cordially. When
Van returned, he insisted on the young fireman
inspecting the work on the railroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that look like business?&#8221; he inquired, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
they proceeded down the roadbed. &#8220;We have ten
men and eight boys working for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight boys&mdash;where did they come from?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;An orphan asylum burned down and we engaged
to care for them,&#8221; replied Van.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are they doing in those trees?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stringing a telegraph wire. We expect within
a month to have the telegraph through to Springfield,
and later to Dover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Van,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;it seems incredible,
the progress you have made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That five thousand dollars we made old Farrington
pay Mrs. Gibson was a great help,&#8221; replied
Van. &#8220;We have quite a construction crew
here now. I help Mrs. Gibson do the cooking,
and we get on famously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Grant was with his nephew for over an
hour. Then Ralph was sent for, and Trevor
welcomed him with a glad smile. The young man
described how he had been taken to a lonely building
in the woods, how he had escaped from his
enemies, breaking his arm in a runaway flight, and
telling Ralph that he intended to remain where he
was for a month, to which his uncle had agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confidentially, Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
taken a great interest in this Short Cut Railroad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
scheme, and as soon as I am well I am coming to
see you at Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding this railroad?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; responded Trevor. &#8220;I see a great
future in it. I shall not go to Europe. There
is a practical business chance here, and I intend
to help Mr. Gibson get the enterprise through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take a lot of money,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Trevor, &#8220;and I know how to
raise it. In fact, I have almost agreed to market
one hundred thousand dollars&#8217; worth of bonds of
the Dover &amp; Springfield Short Line Railroad, and
I want you to help me do it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A RAILROAD STRIKE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad outlook, lad,&#8221; said old John
Griscom.</p>
<p>The veteran engineer was serious and anxious
as he pronounced the words. He and Ralph were
proceeding down the tracks beyond the round-house,
just returned from their regular run from
the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strike, is it?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than a strike,&#8221; replied Griscom. &#8220;The
railroad men&#8217;s union is in a squabble among themselves
and a fight is on. That means trouble and
damage all around.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was two weeks after the kidnapping of young
Trevor, and affairs had subsided to regular
routine for the engineer and fireman of the Limited
Mail. The president of the Great Northern
had sent a check for one hundred dollars to Ralph,
which he divided with Griscom, both making up
twenty-five dollars for Van Sherwin. From the
actions of their superiors they knew that their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
being in close touch with Mr. Grant had helped
them considerably, and both felt secure and contented
in their positions, when a new disturbing
element appeared.</p>
<p>For several days there had been trouble on both
the Great Northern and the Midland Central. As
Ralph understood it, the discharge of an irresponsible
engineer on the latter line of railroad had
led to a demand for his reinstatement. This the
railway officials refused. A strike was at once
ordered.</p>
<p>Two days later a man named Delmay, a strike
agent, came to Stanley Junction. He demanded
that the men on the Great Northern engage in a
sympathetic strike until the other road was
brought to terms. The older, wiser hands laughed
at him. Jim Evans had returned to Stanley
Junction, and at once joined in a movement to
disrupt the local union by favoring the strike in
question.</p>
<p>Evans had done a good deal of swaggering and
threatening around the roundhouse that day,
Ralph had just learned, and had intimidated some
of the new hands into joining in the strike movement.
He had left word that, as men came in
from their runs, they were to report at a hall
where the strikers met and announce which side
of the contest they favored.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are, lad,&#8221; said the veteran engineer,
as they started up the stairs of a building on Railroad
Street. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look very business-like,
those pails of beer going into that hall yonder and
that cloud of tobacco smoke. I wouldn&#8217;t stir a
foot, only it&#8217;s quite regular according to union
rules to call and report in a matter like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Mr. Griscom?&#8221;
asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Short and sweet, give my sentiments and leave
these loafers to fight it out among themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Include mine,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I do not understand
these strike complications and I know you
do, so I shall follow your guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they entered the hall they found a noisy
crowd, smoking, playing cards and lounging
about. On a platform sat Jim Evans, looking
profoundly important. He sat at a table with a
heap of papers before him. Griscom approached
him, Ralph by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s in charge here?&#8221; demanded the old
engineer gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; announced Evans, in a somewhat unsteady
tone. &#8220;Head of the movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; muttered Griscom. &#8220;Movement
can&#8217;t amount to much, then. Now then, Jim
Evans, just one word. We came here out of
courtesy to the union. We are members in good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
standing, and we represent the majority. At the
meeting last night we voted you out as seceders.
I am authorized to inform you that from now on
no attention whatever will be paid to your crowd
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; sneered Evans. &#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll
attract some attention when we get in action. We
have started our own union. We are going to
break up the old one. Whoever comes in now to
help us holds his job. Whoever don&#8217;t, will
get downed somewhere along the line, and don&#8217;t
you forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being in the wrong,&#8221; predicted Griscom
steadily, &#8220;you won&#8217;t succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sign the roll?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the lad speak for himself,&#8221; said Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know little about these complications, Mr.
Evans,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I pay my dues, and we are
upheld in our positions by the central union. In
the present instance I stand by the regular men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evans angrily picked up a sheet of paper. He
scribbled upon it hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know what that means?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t, and are not at all anxious to know,&#8221;
retorted Griscom, turning to leave the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that you are blacklisted!&#8221; shouted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Evans, rising to his feet. &#8220;As to you, Fairbanks,
I owe you one, and the time has come when I am
in power. Think twice&mdash;join us, or it will be
the worse for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, lad,&#8221; directed Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; roared Evans to his mob of friends,
&#8220;those two are on the black list. Notice them
particularly, and hit hard when you strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went home somewhat disturbed by the
episode, but not at all alarmed. He knew that
such complications were frequent among the
unions. His mother, however, was quite worried
over the affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Evans is a bad man, and has a
personal hatred for you, Ralph,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Besides
that, as we know, he has been incited to
make you trouble by Mr. Farrington. Be careful
of yourself, my son, for I fear he may try to
do you some mischief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only go on in the clear path of duty,&#8221;
said Ralph sturdily.</p>
<p>The next morning the roundhouse was in quite
a tumult. Its vicinity was picketed by the strikers.
Ralph entered the place to find Tim Forgan,
the foreman, in a state of great excitement and
worry. There were not men enough for the
regular runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take out your regular train,&#8221; he said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Griscom, &#8220;but I believe it will be annulled and new
orders issued at the city end of the line. We&#8217;re in
for trouble, I can tell you. The strikers make
some pretty bad threats, and you want to watch
every foot of the route until this strike is settled
one way or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no other way except to oppose these
loafers boldly,&#8221; pronounced Griscom. &#8220;The
union has expelled them, and they are on the
basis of rioters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the railroad company will make some
move to protect its property,&#8221; said Forgan. &#8220;They
must give us more men, though, or we will have
to annul half the daily trains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Limited Mail got out of the yards with
some difficulty. They had a spiked switch to look
out for, and a missile from an old building
smashed the headlight glass. At the limits a man
tossed a folded paper into the locomotive cab. It
was a poor scrawl containing direful threats to
anyone opposing the new union.</p>
<p>When they reached the terminus Griscom found
a committee of men from the central union waiting
for him. They held a consultation. Then
a messenger from the railway office came after
him. It was a busy day for the veteran rail-roader.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the looks of things,&#8221; he said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
Ralph, as they started on the homeward run.
&#8220;The central union backs us, and the company is
bound to fight the strikers to a finish. A lot of
men are going down to take the places of the
strikers. We are carrying them on this train, and
serious trouble will begin as soon as the new
men go to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two days later the freight traffic of the Great
Northern was practically tied up. The situation
had become positively alarming. The strikers had
gathered strength of numbers through intimidation,
and the coming of new workers had aroused
animosity.</p>
<p>Car loads of perishable fruits and the like were
rotting in the yards, men were beaten, engines
crippled, orders mixed up, crown sheets burned
and cars smashed on open switches.</p>
<p>The Limited Mail was annulled as a regular
train, and Griscom and Ralph and all other passenger
employes placed on the irregular list.
One day a man would take out the Mail, the next
day he would be running freight empties to the
city.</p>
<p>Some cars on siding along the route had been
set on fire, and Griscom and Ralph were ordered
down the line to pick up freight strays and haul
them to the yards at Dover. It proved an unpleasant
task. Strikers annoyed them in every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
way possible. Finally with a mixed train of
about twenty cars they arrived at Afton, and took
the sidings to gather in half-a-dozen gondolas.</p>
<p>The spot was remote from the main tracks.
Ralph had to do the coupling. He had run back,
bound on this duty in the present instance, when,
just as he reached the end of their train, three
ill-appearing men stepped into view from a dismantled
switch shanty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop your signaling,&#8221; spoke one of the three,
advancing menacingly towards Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; responded Ralph calmly, &#8220;seeing we
want these cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t take them,&#8221; retorted the man, placing
himself between the halted train and the cars
beyond.</p>
<p>Ralph calmly gave the signal to the engine.
The train backed. The man had to jump quickly
out of the way. Ralph set the coupling pin, gave
a quick signal and sprang into the first empty car.
The man who had spoken to him followed him
through the opposite open doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetch him out!&#8221; cried his two companions,
running along the side of the car. &#8220;Maul him,
and send him back to Stanley Junction as a lesson
to the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man attempted to seize Ralph and the
latter resisted. The fellow called to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
companions, and they sprang into the car. Ralph,
trying to reach the doorway to leap out, was
tripped up, and he fell quite heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toss him out!&#8221; growled his first assailant, but
Ralph recovered himself, managed to gain his
feet, and leaped to the ground outside.</p>
<p>The three men followed. Ralph ran behind a
pile of railroad ties. His pursuers gained upon
him. He stumbled, fell flat, and they pounced
upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on there,&#8221; suddenly spoke a new voice.
&#8220;Get back and stay back, or I&#8217;ll know the reason
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something whizzed through the air. It was a
heavy cudgel. Whack! whack! whack! the three
fellows retreated as their shoulders were assailed
good and hard.</p>
<p>Ralph in some surprise regarded his new
friend. He was a queer-looking old man, carrying
a formidable cudgel, and this he now brandished
recklessly in the faces of his adversaries,
beating them back step by step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you mind your own business,&#8221; he
warned the men. &#8220;Pitching onto a boy&mdash;three
big loafers that you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>The men were cowards and sneaked sullenly
away. Ralph&#8217;s rescuer went back to the pile of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
ties and took up a little open memorandum book
lying there.</p>
<p>Ralph noticed that its pages bore a list of numbers,
as of cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very grateful to you,&#8221; said the young
fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; responded the stranger, and
ran his eye over the cars as they passed by as if
looking at their numbers. Ralph concluded that
he had some business on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in the service of the railroad?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded the man&mdash;&#8220;of many railroads.
I am a professional car finder.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE RUNAWAY TRAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph and his companion followed the train
till it left the siding, when the young fireman set
the switch and they stood by the side of the track
until the locomotive backed down to where they
were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going into Dover?&#8221; inquired the man who had
rendered Ralph such signal service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Griscom, looking the questioner
over suspiciously, as was his custom with all
strangers recently since the strike began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a lift, will you? I am through with
my work here,&#8221; observed the man. &#8220;My name is
Drury. I am a car finder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; said the old engineer with some interest
of manner. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you fellows.
Often thought I&#8217;d like the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t, if you knew its troubles and
difficulties,&#8221; asserted Drury with a laugh, as he
climbed into the tender. &#8220;You think it&#8217;s just
riding around and asking a few questions. Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
say, I have spent a whole month tracing down
two strays alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; said Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is true. You see, cars get on a line
shy of them, and they keep them purposely. Then,
again, cars are lost in wrecks, burned up, or
thrown on a siding and neglected. You would be
surprised to know how many cars disappear and
are never heard of again.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a new phase in railroad life to Ralph,
and he was greatly interested. He plied the man
with questions, and gained a good deal of information
from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Switch off here, Fairbanks,&#8221; ordered Griscom,
as they neared a siding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your name Fairbanks?&#8221; asked the carfinder
of Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard of you,&#8221; said Drury, glancing keenly at
the young fireman. &#8220;It was down at Millville,
last week. They seem to think a good deal of
you, the railroad men there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I deserve it,&#8221; said Ralph modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Took a meal at a restaurant kept by a friend
of yours,&#8221; continued the carfinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Limpy Joe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Original little fellow&mdash;spry, handy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and accommodating. Met another genius there&mdash;Dallas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zeph? Yes,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;He has got lots
to learn, but he has the making of a man in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has. He was greatly interested in my
position. Wanted me to hire him right away.
Said he knew he could find any car that was ever
lost. I gave him a job,&#8221; and Drury smiled
queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a job?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you ask him when you see him,&#8221; said
Drury mysteriously. &#8220;I promised to keep it a
secret,&#8221; and he smiled again. &#8220;Good-bye, I leave
you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Griscom to his young assistant,
&#8220;orders are to run to Ridgeton and start out
in the morning picking up strays between there
and Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they got to Ridgeton, it had begun to
rain. It was a lonely station with a telegraph
operator, and a few houses quite a distance away.
The operator was not on duty nights since the
strike. The engine was sidetracked. They got
a meal at the nearest house, and the operator gave
them the key to the depot, where he said they
could sleep all night on the benches. This Griscom
insisted on doing, in order that they might
keep an eye on the locomotive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>They sat up until about nine o&#8217;clock. Then,
tired out with a hard day&#8217;s work, both soon sank
into profound sleep. It was some time later when
both, always vigilant and easily aroused, awoke
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the old engineer drowsily, &#8220;only the
ticker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, some one is telegraphing,&#8221; answered
Ralph, &#8220;but it is a hurry call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand the code, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;Quiet, please, for a
moment. Mr. Griscom, this is urgent,&#8221; and Ralph
arose and hurried to the next room, where the
instrument was located.</p>
<p>He listened to the sharp ticking of the little
machine. There was the double-hurry call. Then
came some sharp, nervous clicks.</p>
<p>&#8220;R-u-n-a-w-a-y,&#8221; he spelled out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Griscom, springing to his
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;J-u-s-t p-a-s-s-e-d W-i-l-m-e-r, s-i-x
f-r-e-i-g-h-t c-a-r-s. S-t-o-p t-h-e-m a-t R-i-d-g-e-t-o-n,
o-r t-h-e-y w-i-l-l m-e-e-t N-o. f-o-r-t-y-e-i-g-h-t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked up excitedly. Griscom stood by
his side. His eyes were wide awake enough now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Repeat that message&mdash;quick, lad!&#8221; he said in
a suppressed tone. &#8220;Can you signal for repeat?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Ralph did so, once more spelling out the message
as it came over the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. 48?&#8221; spoke Griscom rapidly. &#8220;That is the
special passenger they have been sending out from
Stanley Junction since the strike. What is the
next station north? Act! Wire north to stop the
train.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph got the next station with some difficulty.
A depressing reply came. No. 48 had passed
that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;s somewhere on the thirty-mile
stretch between there and here,&#8221; said Griscom.
&#8220;Lad, it is quick action&mdash;wind blowing a hurricane,
and those freights thundering down a one
per cent. grade. Bring the lantern. Don&#8217;t lose a
moment. Hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph took the lead, and they rushed for their
locomotive. The young fireman got a red lantern
and ran down the track, set the light, and was
back to the engine quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is bad, very bad,&#8221; said Griscom. &#8220;Nothing
but this siding, ending at a big ravine, the
only track besides the main. The runaway must
have a fearful momentum on that grade. What
can we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph tested the valves. He found sufficient
steam on to run the engine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can suggest only one thing, Mr. Griscom,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it, lad, there is not a moment to
lose,&#8221; hurriedly directed the old engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get onto the main, back down north, set the
switch here to turn the runaways onto the siding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose No. 48 gets here first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must take the risk, start south till
she reaches the danger signals, and sacrifice our
engine, that is all,&#8221; said Ralph plainly.</p>
<p>It was a moment of intense importance and
strain. In any event, unless the unexpected happened,
No. 48 or their own locomotive would be
destroyed. On the coming passenger were men,
women and children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty, lad,&#8221; said Griscom, in a kind of desperate
gasp. &#8220;We must not hesitate. Pile in the
black diamonds and hope for the best. If we can
reach the creek before the runaways, we can
switch them onto a spur. It means a smash into
the freights there. But anything to save the
precious lives aboard the night passenger from
Stanley Junction.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ran on slowly, then, gaining speed, got a
full head of steam on the cylinders. At a curve
the bridge lights came into view.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see?&#8221; demanded Griscom, his
band trembling on the throttle, wide open now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming,&#8221; cried Ralph. &#8220;I caught the
glint of the bridge lights. She&#8217;s not six hundred
yards away.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a desperate situation now. Both engineer
and fireman realized this. The backward swing
was caught, and down the course they had just
come their locomotive sped with frightful velocity.</p>
<p>It was a mad race, but they had the advantage.
One mile, two miles, three miles, the depot, down
the main, and before the engine had stopped,
Ralph was on the ground. He ran to the switch,
set it, and then both listened, watched and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the runaways,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>Yes, there they were, speeding like phantoms
over the rain-glistening steel. Nearer and nearer
they came, passed the siding, struck the switch,
ran its length, and then a crash&mdash;and the night
passenger from Stanley Junction was saved!</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the damage will be,&#8221; muttered
Griscom in a long-drawn breath of relief,
&#8220;but we have done our duty as we saw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They got back on the siding and removed the
red lights before No. 48 arrived. The night
passenger sped tranquilly by, her train crew little
dreaming of the peril they had escaped.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, when they arrived at Stanley
Junction, the assistant superintendent of the
road highly commended their action in regard to
the runaway freights.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Ralph went home tired out from strain of
work and excitement. As he neared the house
he noticed a wagon in the yard and a horse browsing
beside it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that rig belongs to Limpy
Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph hurried into the house. He found both
Joe and Zeph in the sitting room. They were
conversing with his mother, with whom the
cripple boy had always been a great favorite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, fellows, I am glad to see you,&#8221; said
Ralph heartily, &#8220;but what brought you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plainly,&#8221; replied Limpy Joe&mdash;&#8220;Ike Slump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221; inquired the young
fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that we have been burned out,&#8221; said
Joe, &#8220;and Ike Slump did it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>CAR NO. 9176</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Burned out!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph, deeply concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Joe, a trifle dolefully. &#8220;Labors
of years in ashes&mdash;Limpy Joe&#8217;s Railroad Restaurant
a thing of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spite work. Three nights ago, late in the
evening, Ike Slump appeared at the restaurant
and demanded a free meal. I gave it to him.
Then he demanded some money, and I refused it.
He became bold and ugly, and told us how his
crowd had it in for us, that they knew I had some
hand in helping you get that stolen plunder, and
would fix us sooner or later. He advised me to
buy them off. I sent him away. Last night we
discovered the place on fire, and it was burned to
the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was deeply distressed over his friend&#8217;s
misfortune. The lame fellow, however, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
undaunted. He deplored his loss, but he was by no
means discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankful to have the horse and wagon left,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I can always earn a living with that.
Besides that, we saw Van Sherwin the other day.
He is getting on finely, and I think we could get
work on the Short Line Railroad. For the present,
though, I am going to stay at Stanley Junction.
I have a dozen plans for getting a little
money together. Will you try us as boarders for
a week or two, Ralph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I answered that question a few minutes ago,&#8221;
reminded Mrs. Fairbanks, &#8220;and if you two will
sleep in the same room, you will cause no inconvenience
whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Zeph?&#8221; said Ralph, turning to the
farmer boy.</p>
<p>Zeph had been strangely silent. He appeared
to be trying to look very dignified and much absorbed
in thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, me?&#8221; he said now. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m already
at work. Commence to-night. Call boy at the
roundhouse. Old one is with the strikers. Mr.
Forgan engaged me this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that is fine,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;A start in
the right direction. Look out for the strikers,
though, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about me,&#8221; advised Zeph. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
fighter when aroused. See, here is my list to call
in the morning,&#8221; and he showed Ralph a slip of
paper containing about a dozen names.</p>
<p>Ralph read it over, and after a meal went out
with Zeph and showed him the location of the
homes of those named in the list.</p>
<p>&#8220;This job is all right,&#8221; said Zeph, as they returned
to the house, &#8220;but it is only a sort of side
line with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; smiled Ralph, amused at the off-hand,
yet self-important manner of his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply want to get into the service so as to
have the privilege of riding around on engines
when I want to. It sort of introduces me, you
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to ride around on engines
for?&#8221; asked Ralph. &#8220;You can&#8217;t afford to waste
your time that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waste my time? waste my time?&#8221; repeated
Zeph. &#8220;Huh, guess you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re
talking about! I&#8217;m on the trail of a big fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. Ralph Fairbanks, I&#8217;ll let you into the
secret. You&#8217;ve been a good friend to me, and
you shall help me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What ridiculous nonsense are you talking,
Zeph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see whether it&#8217;s nonsense or not when
some day I walk in on you with a fortune. Now,
this is on the dead quiet, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; laughed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I met a fellow the other day, who
is a car finder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Drury, you mean?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; questioned Zeph in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me he had met you, and agreed with
me that you were a pretty fair kind of a fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221; said Zeph, very much pleased at the
double compliment. &#8220;Well, I got interested in
his business and he finally gave me a&mdash;a&mdash;well
a job, you might call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Salary big, Zeph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No salary at all,&#8221; responded Zeph. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
partnership deal. If I find certain property, I
am to have a big reward to divide with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Diamonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, going digging for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of me, Fairbanks,&#8221; said Zeph
in a slightly offended tone. &#8220;This is a fair and
square business proposition. About five years ago
a car was lost, presumably on the Great Northern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
At least, it can be traced no farther than the
terminus of the Midland Central, where it was
switched onto this line here. There all trace of it
was lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Valuable freight aboard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, on the contrary, it was empty, but, all the
same, between sealed boards and the rough ones
a pocketbook containing a lot of valuable diamonds
was hidden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A traveling jewelry salesman named Isaacs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he hide it there for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to. You see, he was on another railroad
line and crossing some tracks when some
footpads assaulted him. He managed to escape
and got into the empty car I told you about.
Then he heard them coming to search for him,
and hid the diamonds in a break of the boards at
one side of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They dragged him out, beat him into insensibility
and stole all his money. He woke up in a
hospital a month later, after a siege of fever. The
first thing he thought of was the diamonds and the
car. He had taken particular pains to note the
number of the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confidentially?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It belonged to the Southern Air Line Road,
and its number was 9176.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are telling a very interesting story,&#8221;
declared Ralph, now really interested in the same.
&#8220;He searched for the car, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once. He telegraphed everywhere; he advertised;
he employed detectives. It was no use.
During the month of his illness, car No. 9176 had
disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The car finder says not at all. Such things
happen frequently. But it went somewhere,
didn&#8217;t it? It may be lying on some old siding,
in some creek after a wreck, stolen by gravel pit
men, or in service still on some line. One thing
is sure, if in existence still, it must be on one of
four railroad lines, and the Great Northern is
one of those roads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you propose to do?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over every one of those lines carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Drury has done that already, has he
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it? A first search doesn&#8217;t always
bring results. He has given me full details as to
the car, and, according to the records, it was lost
on the Great Northern. In a day or two I am
going to have a look at the transfer records at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
Dover. Then I am going to look up the trainmen
who probably hauled the car. Oh, I have a theory
and a plan. If I find the car I shall be almost
rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bad prospect, Zeph,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;but
if I were you I would stick at regular work and
make the search for that car a secondary matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll remember it and help me out if you
can?&#8221; asked Zeph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely I will,&#8221; and Ralph made a note of the
number of the car in his memorandum book.</p>
<p>When the young fireman arose the next morning,
he found Zeph seated on the front porch
lounging back in an easy chair and his face all
bandaged up. Mrs. Fairbanks stood near by, regarding
her guest solicitously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter, Zeph?&#8221; inquired
Ralph in profound surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whipped four men, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; answered
Zeph with a smile that was almost ghastly, for his
lips were all cut and swollen up, one eye disfigured
and two teeth gone. &#8220;I went on my rounds this
morning. I made sure to wake up the fellows on
call, and one of them threatened to kill me if I
ever came to his door again with that &#8216;fog-horn
holler&#8217; of mine, as he called it. The night watch-man
said he&#8217;d arrest me for disturbing the peace.
I didn&#8217;t mind that. Then I ran across four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
strikers. They wanted me to join them. I refused,
and&mdash;that&#8217;s all, except that I&#8217;ll bet they
are worse off than I am, if it was four to one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to keep right on at your job?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; cried the undaunted Zeph. &#8220;Well, if
anything would make me it would be this attack
on me. Tell you, Fairbanks, hot times are coming.
Forgan was on duty all night, and he told
me this morning to advise you to be extra cautious
in coming to work. The strikers are in an ugly
mood, and they are going to make a bold break
to smash up things to-day, they threaten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Ralph, &#8220;affairs must come to a
crisis sooner or later, I fear. Duty is plain,
though. I shall stick to Griscom, and Griscom
insists that he will stick to the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairbanks looked anxious and frightened.
Turning to enter the house, the young fireman
started violently and his mother and Zeph uttered
exclamations of excitement.</p>
<p>A terrific explosion had rent the air. Its echoes
rang out far and wide, and its source seemed to be
the railroad depot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ralph! what does that mean?&#8221; cried
Mrs. Fairbanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said Ralph seriously, &#8220;the strikers are
rioting and the trouble has begun.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>UNDER SEALED ORDERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The young fireman was soon headed for the
railroad yards. A good many people were
bound hurriedly in the same direction, for the
explosion had aroused the town.</p>
<p>As he neared the place, he could hear considerable
shouting. He came to the tracks at a point
where there was a switch shanty. The man on
duty looked worried and scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the trouble?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strikers have blown up a freight car with
dynamite,&#8221; replied the flagman. &#8220;They have
threatened me, old and feeble as I am. I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;ll have to lay off till this trouble is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the distance Ralph saw the mere skeleton of
a freight car. It was in flames, and a number of
men were pushing other cars from its vicinity to
prevent them from catching on fire. A man
tapped him on the shoulder. Turning, Ralph
recognized one of the strikers.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
decent sort, as you know, but I think our position
is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that look like it?&#8221; demanded the young
fireman, pointing to the burning car.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not responsible for that,&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;and I can&#8217;t prevent the hot-headed ones from
violence. I know you won&#8217;t join us, but I&#8217;m just
friendly enough to give you a warning. Don&#8217;t go
on duty to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly shall, if I am needed,&#8221; replied
Ralph. &#8220;Your union is in bad hands, and can&#8217;t
last.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders and Ralph
passed on his way. A piece of coal came whizzing
through the air a few minutes later from the
vicinity of a crowd of loiterers. It knocked off
the young fireman&#8217;s cap. He picked it up and
walked slowly on.</p>
<p>When he came to the roundhouse, he found
the doors shut. Most of the windows in the
place were broken in. Several target rods near
by lay on the ground, and at a glance Ralph saw
that considerable damage had been wrought during
the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be a crisis soon,&#8221; he said, and
went to the roundhouse door. Before he was admitted
several stones rained about him, thrown
from behind a pile of ties. Inside, Ralph found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Griscom and several others among the older engineers
and firemen. All hands looked serious,
the foreman particularly so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you came,&#8221; said Forgan. &#8220;There&#8217;s bad
trouble brewing. The strike has reached the
danger point. We can&#8217;t run any regulars from
the depot and won&#8217;t try to to-day, but the Limited
Mail must go to terminus. Griscom is ready for
the run; are you? The regular engineer and fireman
say they won&#8217;t risk their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see the train anywhere,&#8221; observed
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is to be no regular train, only one postal
and one express car. They will back down here
in half-an-hour from the limits. Here is a wire
for you. Came early this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some surprise Ralph read a brief telegram.
It came from the headquarters of the
Great Northern in the city, was signed by the
president of the road, and read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to my office immediately on reaching
terminus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph showed this to Griscom. The situation
was discussed by the men in the roundhouse, and
the time passed by until a sharp whistle announced
the arrival of the Limited Mail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>As Griscom and Ralph went outside to relieve
those temporarily in charge of the locomotive,
they were pelted from several points with pieces
of dirt, iron and coal. A crowd surged up to the
engine. Then a startling thing occurred that dispersed
them more quickly than they had gathered.</p>
<p>As if by magic there appeared on the platforms
of the two coaches fully a dozen guards armed
with rifles. The train now proceeded on its way
without molestation. At the limits the guards
left it to protect other railroad property.</p>
<p>The only trouble experienced during the run
was between Afton and Dover, when some missiles
were thrown and two switches found spiked.
When they reached the city, Ralph tidied up and
went to see the president of the road.</p>
<p>Mr. Grant received him with a pleasant smile,
beckoned him to a comfortable seat, and, closing
the door of his private office, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks, we think a good deal of you, and
I know you deserve that favorable opinion. There
are many trusted and reliable men in our service,
but they do not think as quickly as you do. You
are familiar with people at Stanley Junction, and
on that account I wish you to do an important
service for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be pleased to,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is this: Some one is working against us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
some one is undermining us. We now believe
that the sympathetic strike, as it is called, is more
the result of some plot than a genuine sentiment
of unionism. A man named Delmay, from the
Midland Central, and a man named Evans, a
discharged employe of our road, are at the head
of the movement. Both are persons of bad record
in every way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; murmured Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that these men are hired to promote
the strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, by whom, Mr. Grant?&#8221; inquired Ralph
in considerable surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;That we wish you to find out. All we suspect
is that some outside party is inciting them to the
strike to carry out some selfish personal ends.
You must find out who he is. You must discover
his motives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was perplexed. He could not understand
the situation at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will do all I can in the line you suggest, sir,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;although I hardly know where to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find a way to make your investigation,&#8221;
declared the president of the Great Northern.
&#8220;I rely a great deal upon your ability already
displayed in ferreting out mysteries, and on your
good, solid, common sense in going to work cautiously
and intelligently on a proposition. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
can tell Forgan you are relieved on special service
and wire me personally when you make any
discoveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph arose to leave the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; continued Mr. Grant, taking
up an envelope. &#8220;I wish you to hand this to
Griscom. The Limited Mail will not make any
return trip to-night. Instead, a special will be
ready for you. You need mention this to no one.
That envelope contains sealed orders and is not
to be opened until you start on your trip. The
superintendent of the road will see you leave and
will give you all further instructions needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a certain air of mystery to this
situation that perplexed Ralph. He reported to
Griscom, who took the letter with a curious
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be something extra going on down the
road,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Wonder what? Start after
dark, too. Hello, I say&mdash;the pay car.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had come to the depot to observe an engine,
two cars attached, and the superintendent
standing on the platform conversing with a man
attired in the garb of a fireman.</p>
<p>The latter was a sturdy man of middle age, one
of the best firemen on the road, as Ralph knew.
He nodded to Griscom and Ralph, while the
superintendent said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks, this man will relieve you on the
run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then I am not to go on this
trip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; answered the official with a grim
smile,&mdash;&#8220;that is, if you are willing, but it must
be as a passenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph glanced at the passenger coach. Inside
were half-a-dozen guards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in there,&#8221; replied the superintendent,
&#8220;We want you to occupy the pay car here. Everything
is ready for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The superintendent unlocked the heavy rear
door of the pay car, led the way to the tightly
sealed front compartment, and there Ralph found
a table, chair, cot, a pail of drinking water and
some eatables.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make yourself comfortable,&#8221; said the
official. &#8220;There will probably be no trouble, but
if there is, operate this wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker pointed to a wire running parallel
with the bell rope to both ends of the train. On
the table lay a rifle. The only openings in the
car were small grated windows at either end.</p>
<p>The official left the car, locking in Ralph. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
young fireman observed a small safe at one end
of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably contains a good many thousands of
dollars,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;Well, here is a newspaper,
and I shall try to pass the time comfortably.&#8221;</p>
<p>By getting on a chair and peering through the
front ventilator, Ralph could obtain a fair view
of the locomotive. The train started up, and
made good time the first thirty miles. Then
Ralph knew from a halt and considerable switching
that they were off the main rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, peering through the grating,
&#8220;they have switched onto the old cut-off between
Dover and Afton.&#8221;</p>
<p>That had really occurred, as the young fireman
learned later. The officials of the road, it appeared,
feared most an attack between those two
points, and the sealed orders had directed Griscom
to take the old, unused route, making a long
circuit to the main line again.</p>
<p>Ralph remembered going over this route once&mdash;rusted
rails, sinking roadbed, watery wastes at
places flooding the tracks. He kept at the grating
most of the time now, wondering if Griscom
could pilot them through in safety.</p>
<p>Finally there was a whistle as if in response to
a signal, then a sudden stop and then a terrible
jar. Ralph ran to the rear grating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the guard car has been detached,
there are Mr. Griscom and the engineer
in the ditch, and the locomotive and pay car running
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could look along the tracks and observe all
this. Engineer and fireman had apparently been
knocked from the cab. Some one was on the rear
platform of the pay car, a man who was now
clambering to its roof. The guards ran out of
the detached coach and fired after the stolen train,
but were too late.</p>
<p>Rapidly the train sped along. Ralph ran to the
front grating. The locomotive was in strange
hands and the tender crowded with strange men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a plain case,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;These men have
succeeded in stealing the pay car, and that little
safe in the corner is what they are after.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train ran on through a desolate waste, then
across a trestle built over a swampy stretch of
land. At its center there was a jog, a rattle, the
tracks gave way, and almost with a crash, the
train came to a halt.</p>
<p>It took some time to get righted again, and the
train proceeded very slowly. Ralph had done a
good deal of thinking. He knew that soon the
robbers would reach some spot where they would
attack the pay car.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must defeat their purpose,&#8221; he said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
himself. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let myself out, but&mdash;the safe! A
good idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph settled upon a plan of action. He was
busily engaged during the next half hour. When
the train came to a final stop, there was an active
scene about it.</p>
<p>Half-a-dozen men, securing tools from the
locomotive, started to break in the door of the
pay car. In this they soon succeeded.</p>
<p>They went inside. The safe was the object of
all their plotting and planning, but the safe was
gone, and Ralph Fairbanks was nowhere in the
pay car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE STRIKE LEADER</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph felt that he had done a decidedly timely
and clever act in outwitting the train robbers. He
had left the car almost as it stopped, and under
the cover of the dark night had gained the
shelter of the timber lining the track.</p>
<p>The young fireman waited until the men came
rushing out of the car. They were dismayed and
furious, and, leaving them in a noisy and excited
consultation, Ralph started back towards the
trestle work.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t get the safe, that is sure,&#8221; said
the young railroader in tones of great satisfaction,
as he hurried along in the pelting storm. &#8220;They
will scarcely pursue me. It is pretty certain,
however, that they will be pursued, and I may
meet an engine before I reach Dover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as he neared the end of the trestle Ralph
saw at some distance the glint of a headlight. It
was unsteady, indicating the uncertain character
of the roadbed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About two miles away,&#8221; decided the young
fireman. &#8220;I must manage to stop them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With considerable difficulty, Ralph secured
sufficient dry wood and leaves in among some
bushes to start a fire between the rails and soon
had a brisk blaze going. The headlight came
nearer and nearer. A locomotive halted. Ralph
ran up to the cab.</p>
<p>It contained Griscom, the city fireman and two
men armed with rifles. The old engineer peered
keenly at the figure, quickly springing to the step
of the engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, lad?&#8221; he cried heartily. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad of
that. Where is the train?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About two miles further on beyond the
trestle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the pay car?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The robbers were in possession when I left
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they will get away with the safe!&#8221; cried
the engineer excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; observed Ralph, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, lad, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I say. Truth is, I saw what was coming.
There was only one thing to do. There
were tools in the car. I sawed a hole through
the floor of the car, rolled the safe to it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
dumped it through. It went between two rotten
ties, and lies in the swamp&mdash;safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a shout of delight old John Griscom
slapped his young assistant admiringly on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re a jewel! Mate,&#8221;
to the fireman, &#8220;this is glad news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; said his companion. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t like the record of losing that safe. Can
you locate the spot, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may take some trouble,&#8221; answered Ralph.
&#8220;The best thing to do is to get a wrecking car
here; meantime, the trestle should be guarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ran on and up to the spot where the
stolen train was halted, but found the vicinity
deserted. It seemed that whatever the robbers
had guessed out as to the mystery of the safe,
they did not consider there was any chance of
recovering it.</p>
<p>The two men armed with rifles remained at
the trestle, while the others took the stolen pay
car back to Dover. Once there, Griscom kept the
wires busy for a time. About daylight a wrecking
crew was made up. Ralph accompanied them to
the scene of the attempted robbery.</p>
<p>He could fairly estimate the locality of the
sunken safe, and some abrasions of the ties finally
indicated the exact spot where the safe had gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
through into the water below. It was grappled
for, found, and before noon that day the pay car
train arrived at Stanley Junction with the safe
aboard.</p>
<p>Affairs at the terminal town were still in an unsettled
condition. The presence of armed guards
prevented wholesale attacks on the railroad
property, but there were many assaults on workmen
at lonely spots, switches tampered with and
shanty windows broken in.</p>
<p>Ralph reported to Tim Forgan and then went
home. He went to sleep at once, awoke refreshed
about the middle of the afternoon, and then told
his mother all the occurrences of that day and the
preceding one.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Fairbanks was pleased at the confidence
reposed in her son by the railroad authorities,
she was considerably worried at the
constant turmoil and dangers of the present railroad
situation. Ralph, however, assured her that
he would take care of himself, and left the house
trying to form some plan to follow out the instructions
of the president of the Great Northern.</p>
<p>He could not go among the strikers, and without
doing so, or sending a spy among them, it
would be difficult to ascertain their motives and
projects. Coming around a street corner, the
young fireman halted abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>A procession of strikers was coming down the
street. They were a noisy, turbulent mob,
cheered on by like rowdyish sympathizers lining
the pavements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph, as he
noticed by the side of Jim Evans, the leader of the
crowd, his young friend, Zeph Dallas.</p>
<p>The latter seemed to share the excitement of
the paraders. He acted as if he gloried in being
a striker, and the familiar way Evans treated him
indicated that the latter regarded him as a
genuine, first-class recruit.</p>
<p>Zeph caught Ralph&#8217;s eye and then looked
quickly away. The young fireman was dreadfully
disappointed in the farmer boy. He went at once
to the roundhouse, where the foreman told him
that Zeph had deserted the afternoon previous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; said Forgan. &#8220;The lad
seemed to hate the strikers for attacking him the
other night. I suppose, though, it&#8217;s with him like
a good many others&mdash;there&#8217;s lots of &#8216;relief money&#8217;
being given out, and that&#8217;s the bait that catches
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must manage to see Zeph,&#8221; mused Ralph.
&#8220;I declare, I can hardly believe he is really on
their side. I wonder how near I dare venture to
the headquarters of that mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman went to the vicinity of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
hall occupied by the strikers, but he did not meet
Zeph. Then Ralph proceeded to the business
portion of Stanley Junction. He visited the bank
and several other leading local business institutions.
He made a great many inquiries and he
felt that he was on the edge of some important
discoveries.</p>
<p>When he got home he found Zeph sitting on
the porch, smiling as ever. Ralph nodded seriously
to him. Zeph grinned outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that kind of a welcome for, eh?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to see you in the ranks of the strikers
to-day, Zeph,&#8221; observed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought to be glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose a fellow is free to follow out his
convictions, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m following out mine,&#8221; declared
Zeph&mdash;&#8220;the conviction that of all the mean rascals
in this burg, Jim Evans is the meanest. See here,
Fairbanks, have you lost your wits? Do you
really for one minute suppose I sympathize with
those fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seemed pretty close to Evans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand!&#8221; chuckled Zeph. &#8220;That&#8217;s just what I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
was working for. See here, I made up my mind
that those fellows were up to more mischief than
what they have already done. I concluded there
was something under the surface of this pretended
strike. I wanted to find out. I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked very much interested now. He
began to see the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Zeph,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I found out just what I suspected&mdash;some
one is furnishing the strikers with money, and lots
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, but I do know one thing: every day
Evans goes to the office of a certain lawyer in
town here. They have a long consultation.
Evans always comes away very much satisfied
and with more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the lawyer&#8217;s name, Zeph?&#8221; inquired
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then they were called in to supper by Mrs.
Fairbanks. Ralph was silent and thoughtful during
most of the meal.</p>
<p>The young fireman had learned that afternoon
that a stranger named Bartlett had been buying
up all the stock of the railroad he could secure.
The man was not in good repute at Stanley Junction.
He had come there only the week previous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Ralph was told, and occupied a mean little room
in the main office building of the town.</p>
<p>After supper Ralph strolled down town. He
entered the building in question and ascended its
stairs. He knew the occupants of most of the
offices, and finally located a room which contained
a light but had no sign on the door.</p>
<p>Footsteps ascending the stairs caused the young
fireman to draw back into the shadow. A man
came into view and knocked noisily at the closed
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here I am, Bartlett,&#8221; said the fellow, lurching
about in an unsteady way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are,&#8221; responded the man inside the
room, &#8220;primed for work, too, it seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph could not repress some excitement. The
man Bartlett he instantly recognized as the person
who had delivered to him in the city the papers
from Gasper Farrington. His visitor he knew to
be a discharged telegraph operator of the Great
Northern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the latter, as the door closed on
him, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready for work, so bring on your wire-tapping
scheme soon as you like.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE WIRE TAPPERS</h3>
</div>
<p>When the door of the office that Ralph was
watching closed again and was locked, the young
fireman approached the room. He was very sure
that some important move against the railroad
was meditated by the two men he had just seen,
and he was anxious to overhear their conversation
if possible.</p>
<p>To his intense satisfaction Ralph found that a
coal box rested under the clouded-glass window
of the office looking into the hallway. This window
was down from the top some inches. Ralph
clambered up on the coal box, got to the side of
the window, fixed his eye at a small space where
the glass was broken, and prepared to listen to the
words of the two men he had in view.</p>
<p>Both sat in chairs now. Bartlett looked brisk
and pleased; the ex-telegraph operator was unkempt,
rather sullen, and acted like a man under
orders on some unpleasant duty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Morris,&#8221; said the former, &#8220;all ready, are
you? Tools and wire in that bag?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Batteries and all, complete outfit,&#8221; responded
the other. &#8220;What&#8217;s the programme?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t mentioned about my employing
you to any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have arranged to stay away from town
for several days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A week, if you like, at ten dollars a day you
promised me,&#8221; answered Morris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. Let me see. There&#8217;s a train
about 10 o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, if the strikers will let it run out,&#8221;
said Morris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they will. I have arranged all that,&#8221;
chuckled Bartlett. &#8220;They&#8217;ll even help it on, knowing
I&#8217;m aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; muttered Morris. &#8220;You must have
a pull somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, or at least money has, and I control
the money,&#8221; grinned Bartlett. &#8220;You are to come
with me down the line about twenty miles. You&#8217;ll
be told then about this special job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bartlett got up and bustled about. He packed
a great many papers in a satchel, and finally announced
that they had better be starting for the
depot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Any little by-play you see on the train,&#8221; said
Bartlett, &#8220;help along, mind you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221; inquired Morris.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see when we get there,&#8221; replied Bartlett
enigmatically.</p>
<p>When they reached the depot the two men got
aboard the one passenger coach of the night accommodation.
There was a combination express
car ahead. Ralph went to the messenger in charge
and arranged to have free access to do as he
desired.</p>
<p>When the train started up, he opened the rear
door of the car and commanded a clear view into
the passenger coach. The men he was watching
sat side by side, engaged in conversation. There
were only a few passengers aboard.</p>
<p>Ralph kept his eye on the two men. He noticed
that Bartlett consulted his watch frequently and
glanced as often from the car window. Finally,
when the brakeman was out on the rear platform
and the conductor at the front of the coach, the
young fireman saw Bartlett quickly draw a small
screwdriver from his pocket. Hiding its handle
in his palm and letting the blade run along one
finger, he dropped his arm down the seat rail into
the middle of the aisle.</p>
<p>Morris watched towards the rear platform,
Bartlett kept his eye on the conductor. His hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
worked against the floor of the car. Finally he
drew up his arm, put the screwdriver in his pocket
and once more resumed his watch on the outside
landscape.</p>
<p>There was a sharp signal, and the train gave a
jerk. Bartlett arose to his feet. The next instant
he fell flat headlong, and lay apparently insensible
on the floor of the coach.</p>
<p>The conductor ran outside. The train started
up again. Ralph, from the open doorway, heard
the engineer shout back something about a false
signal, presumably the work of the strikers. The
train proceeded on its way.</p>
<p>It was not until then, as he re-entered the coach,
that the conductor became aware of the prostrate
man on the floor and Morris and other passengers
gathering around him in excitement and solicitude.
Ralph ventured across the platform near
to the door of the passenger coach.</p>
<p>Bartlett, seemingly unconscious, was lifted to
a seat. He soon opened his eyes, but feigned intense
pain in his side, and acted the injured man
to perfection. He began to explain, pointing to
the floor. The conductor investigated. Ralph
saw him draw a long brass screw into sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;A clever game,&#8221; murmured the young fireman.
&#8220;What a rascal the fellow is! He is laying
the foundation for a damage suit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Morris made himself busy, taking the names
of witnesses. When the train stopped, Bartlett
had to be almost lifted from the coach. Ralph
alighted, too, and kept in the shadow. As soon as
the train left, Bartlett was able to walk about
unassisted.</p>
<p>The little town they had arrived at was dark
and silent, and the two men met no one as they
proceeded down its principal street. Then they
turned to the south and walked a distance of
about a mile. There was a kind of a grove lining
the railroad. At its center they reached a lonely
hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open up, there!&#8221; shouted Bartlett, pounding
on its door with a stick he had picked up.</p>
<p>A light soon showed through the cracks of the
board shutters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; demanded a voice from the
inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gasper Farrington,&#8221; murmured Ralph, as he
recognized the occupant of the hut.</p>
<p>It was the magnate of Stanley Junction, still
disguised, just as he had been the last night Ralph
had seen him at the home of Jim Evans. The
three men disappeared within the house. Ralph
approached and went cautiously about the place.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
He could not find a single point where he could
look into the hut.</p>
<p>The young fireman felt that it was very important
that he should learn what was going on
within the house. He at length discovered a way
of gaining access to at least one part of it. This
was at the rear where a high stack of old hay
stood. It almost touched the hut, and its top was
very near to a sashless aperture in the attic.</p>
<p>Ralph scaled the stack with some difficulty and
reached its top. In another moment he was
inside the attic. It was low, the rafters were few
and far between, and, as he crept over these, they
began to sway and creak in an alarming way.</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do at all,&#8221; murmured the youth in
some dismay, for it seemed that one more movement
would carry down the entire ceiling below.
He tried to retreat. There was a great cracking
sound, and before he could help himself the young
fireman went sprawling into the room below in
the midst of a shower of plaster and laths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; shouted Bartlett, jumping up from a
chair in consternation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; exclaimed Morris, dodging
about out of the way of falling bits of plaster
from the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;A spy!&#8221; cried Farrington, &#8220;a spy! Why, it&#8217;s
Ralph Fairbanks!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>The young fireman stood surrounded by the
three men, trying to clear his half-blinded eyes.
He was seized and hustled about, thrown into a
chair, and regained his wonted composure to find
Gasper Farrington confronting him with an angry
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, it&#8217;s you, is it&mdash;you, again?&#8221; spoke the
latter, gazing at Ralph with a glance full of ill
will.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded the youth. &#8220;I can&#8217;t deny it
very well, can I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you come to be up in that attic? How
long have you been there? What are you up to,
anyway?&#8221; shouted the excited Farrington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me any questions for I shall not
answer them,&#8221; retorted Ralph nervily. &#8220;Here I
am. Make the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Bartlett, a deep frown on his
face. &#8220;This looks bad for us. Morris, watch
that young fellow a minute or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and Farrington went into the next room.
There was a low-toned consultation. When they
came back the lawyer carried a piece of rope in
his hand. It was useless for Ralph to resist, and
the three men soon had him securely bound. He
was carried into a small adjoining room, thrown
on a rude mattress, and locked in.</p>
<p>For nearly half-an-hour he could hear the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
drone of low voices in the adjoining room. Then
the door was unlocked, and Farrington came in
with a light and made sure that the captive was
securely bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to leave here, then?&#8221; asked
Bartlett.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I have to?&#8221; demanded Farrington.
&#8220;This fellow has located us. I&#8217;ll take you and
Morris to the place I told you about, and move
my traps out of here early in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with Fairbanks?&#8221;
inquired Bartlett.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about that,&#8221; retorted Farrington
in a grim way. &#8220;It&#8217;s the chance of a lifetime to
settle with him. You leave that to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speakers, shortly after this, left the hut
with Morris. Ralph found he could not release
himself, and patiently awaited developments. His
captors had left the light in the next room and
the door open, and he could see on a table the
satchel the lawyer had brought with him from
his office.</p>
<p>The sight of it caused Ralph to make renewed
efforts for freedom. He strained at his bonds
strenuously. Finally a strand gave way.</p>
<p>It was just as he began to take hope that he
might acquire his liberty before his captors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
returned, that a sudden disaster occurred that made
the young fireman fear for his life.</p>
<p>Some more of the ceiling plastering fell. It
struck the lamp on the table, upset it, and in an
instant the room was ablaze.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>IN PERIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The young fireman gave a great shout of distress
and excitement as he realized that he was
in a decidedly perilous predicament. The oil of
the lamp had ignited and the hut seemed doomed.</p>
<p>Ralph tugged at his bonds in a frenzy. Another
strand of the rope gave way, then another,
and still another. He trembled with mingled surprise
and hope. Could he get free in time? It
seemed not, for the flames were spreading fast
and furiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a shout outside of the hut.
It was repeated, and then there came a great
crash at the door. Ralph wondered at this, for
he could think only of Farrington and his accomplices
returning to the rescue. The loud pounding
on the door, however, indicated that the persons
engaged in it had no key. There was more than
one person; Ralph ascertained this from the sound
of mingled voices.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door gave way. It was burst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
bodily from its hinges and went crashing against
the blazing table, upsetting it. At just that
moment Ralph got one arm free. He was about
to shout for assistance when he recognized the
intruders.</p>
<p>They were Ike Slump and Mort Bemis. Both
dashed into the blazing room. One found a pail
of water and threw it in among the flames. This
subdued the blaze partially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be quick!&#8221; cried Slump to his companion.
&#8220;Grab all you can. You have been watching the
place, and say you know where old Farrington is
likely to hide his valuables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here,&#8221; replied Bemis, tearing open the
door of a cupboard. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a satchel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s another one,&#8221; said Ike Slump,
picking up the one that Bartlett had brought to
the place. &#8220;Look sharp, now. They may come
back at any moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two marauders ransacked the room. Ralph
refrained from calling out to them. He could
now reach his pocket knife, and just as Slump
and Bemis, pretty well singed by the flames, ran
out of the hut, he hurried to a rear door and
darted outside as well.</p>
<p>The young fireman peered around the corner
of the hut. He saw Slump and Bemis making for
the nearest timber. Ralph put after them, and as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
he gained the cover of the woods, looking back,
he made out three figures dashing towards the
blazing hut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Farrington and the others,&#8221; decided Ralph.
&#8220;This is an exciting business. Now to keep track
of Slump and Bemis. I can hardly figure out,
though, how they came to rob the hut, for Farrington
was once their friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The precious pair of thieves scurried along
through the woods, laughing and talking gleefully
over the plunder they had secured. They must
have gone over three miles before they halted.
It was at a spot in among high bushes. Here
they had evidently been camping previously, for
there was a lot of hay on the ground, the signs
of a recent campfire, and a sort of roof of bark
overhead for shelter from rain and dew. They
sat down on the ground and Slump proceeded to
light a lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your watching has amounted to something at
last, Mort,&#8221; said Slump. &#8220;Farrington went back
on us in a measly way. Why, after all we did for
him he took up with Jim Evans and others, and
even refused me a few dollars when we were in
hiding and trouble after that silk robbery. Here&#8217;s
our revenge. He&#8217;s been up to some deep game
for a week. He&#8217;ll never know who stole this
plunder.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Find how much of it there is,&#8221; suggested
Bemis.</p>
<p>Each took up a satchel to investigate the contents.
Ralph was intensely interested. He peered
from a safe covert near at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221; exclaimed Slump as he
opened the satchel taken from the cupboard of the
old hut. &#8220;Why, there&#8217;s a fortune here, if we can
only handle it. Bonds of the Great Northern,
stock in the Great Northern. See? some money&mdash;notes,
mortgages, deeds! This is a big find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here, except the money,&#8221; reported
Bemis, investigating the documents in the satchel
brought from Stanley Junction by Bartlett.
&#8220;Mostly railroad stock in the Great Northern.
Private letters, lists of names of the strikers.
Memoranda about some wire-tapping scheme.
Say, these papers are enough to send the old
skeesicks to the penitentiary. He&#8217;ll pay a fortune
to get them back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slump pocketed the ready cash in the satchel.
Then he was silently thoughtful for a few
moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, I have my scheme,&#8221; he said finally.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll carry these satchels down to the old barge
at the creek, and hide them there. Then we&#8217;ll
block out some plan to work Farrington for their
return.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bemis. &#8220;Come ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>They took up the satchels and started on again,
and Ralph followed them as before. They came
to a creek, and, after lining its shore for nearly
a mile, to a large roughly-made scow. Both
boarded the craft, disappeared in its hold, reappeared,
and came to the shore again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just enjoy the ready cash for the time
being,&#8221; said Slump, &#8220;and later find out a safe
way to deal with Farrington.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they had gone, Ralph went aboard the
scow. A scuttle led down into its hold. Its
cover was closed with a strong spring bolt. Ralph
drew this back and sat over the edge of the
scuttle.</p>
<p>He peered down, prepared to push the cover
clear back, when he slipped and went below head-long.
The cover fell tightly shut, and he was a
prisoner.</p>
<p>Ralph did not mind this much at the time. He
believed he could readily force up the cover in
some way when he wanted to leave the scow. He
lit some matches and proceeded to search for the
two satchels. He found them in a remote corner
of the hold.</p>
<p>It was when he prepared to leave the hold that
the young fireman discovered himself in a decided
quandary. He could barely reach the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
scuttle cover, and there was not an object in the
hold that he could use to force it open. Finally
Ralph decided that he could not hope for escape
in that direction.</p>
<p>There was a little window at one end of the
scow, but it was too small to escape by. Ralph
was compelled to accept the situation, at least until
daylight. He tried to sleep, and at dawn looked
out from the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will simply have to wait here until some one
passes by,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;In the meantime,
though, Slump and Bemis may return. Can I
reach the rope holding the scow to the shore?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was secured around a tree stump. Ralph
reached with his pocket knife through the window,
and began cutting at the scow end of the
rope, which ran just above it.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the strands gave way and the
scow floated down the creek.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A FRIEND IN NEED</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a sluggish current to the creek and
as soon as the scow got into midstream, it proceeded
steadily on its voyage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is better than staying at the old mooring
place,&#8221; reasoned Ralph. &#8220;Of course, Slump and
Bemis will return there and search for the scow.
Before they do, I hope I will have drifted past
some house or settlement where I can call out for
assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph, however, was not destined to meet with
ready relief. The scow floated along banks wild
and timbered, and, during a vigilant watch at the
little window of over two hours, he saw no human
being or habitation.</p>
<p>Finally the scow slowed up, its course became
irregular, it bumped into some obstacle, turned
around, and Ralph discovered the cause of the
stoppage. A mass of logs and other debris had
formed clear across the creek at one point. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the scow lined, edging slowly along as if drawn
by some counter-current.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the craft had worked its way
into a cut-off from the creek. It floated slowly in
among a swampy wilderness of reeds and stunted
trees, came to halt at a shallow, and there remained
stationary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, this is worse than being in the creek,&#8221;
ruminated Ralph, with some concern. &#8220;There was
a chance of hailing some one there sooner or later,
but in this isolated spot I stand the risk of starving
to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman was both hungry and
thirsty. He made another desperate attempt to
force the scuttle, but found it an utter impossibility.
Then he took out his pocket knife. There
was one last chance of escape in sight. If he
could cut the wood away around the bolt of the
scuttle cover, he might force it open.</p>
<p>Ralph could not work to any advantage, for the
top of the hold was fully a foot above his head.
However, patiently and hopefully he began his
task. Bit by bit, the splinters and shavings of
wood dropped about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad, that ends it,&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly,
as there was a sharp snap and the knife blade
broke in two.</p>
<p>The situation was now a very serious one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Ralph tried to view things calmly, but he was
considerably worried. He was somewhat encouraged,
however, a little later, as he noticed that
along the dry land lining the swampy cut-off
there were signs of a rough wagon road.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I can do now is to watch and wait,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;I guess I will take a look over the
contents of those satchels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once started at the task, Ralph became greatly
interested. He was amazed at what the documents
before him revealed of the plans and
villainies of old Gasper Farrington. There was
evidence enough, indeed, as Slump had said, to
send the village magnate to the penitentiary.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information will be of great value to the
railroad people,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;It would enable
them to at once break the strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph gave utterance to a cry of delight and
surprise. He ran to the little window of the
scow. Not fifty feet away was a horse and
wagon. Its driver had shouted out the word to
halt. Now he dismounted and was arranging a
part of the harness where it had come loose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, there! Joe! Joe! hurry this way!&#8221;
fairly shouted Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, who&#8217;s that, where are you?&#8221; demanded
the person hailed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the scow. Ralph! Locked in! Get me
out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare! It can&#8217;t be Ralph. Well! well!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nimbly as his crutches would allow him, Limpy
Joe came towards the scow. He halted as he
neared the window where he could make out the
anxious face of his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you ever doing there? How did
you get in there? Why, this is wonderful, my
finding you in this way,&#8221; cried the cripple.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all that when I get out,&#8221; promised
Ralph. &#8220;All you have to do is to spring back the
bolt catch on the cover to the hold scuttle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon have you out then,&#8221; said Joe, and
with alacrity he waded into the water, got aboard
the old craft, and in another minute Ralph had
lifted himself free of his prison place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew! what a relief,&#8221; aspirated the young
fireman joyfully. &#8220;Joe, it is easy explaining how
I came to be here&mdash;the natural sequence of events&mdash;but
for you to be on hand to save me is marvelous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I have been
coming here for the last three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business, strictly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother told me you had taken the horse and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
wagon and had gone off on a peddling trip,&#8221; said
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I sold out a lot of cheap shoes to farmers
which I got at a bargain at an auction,&#8221; explained
Joe. &#8220;Then I struck a fine new scheme. It
brought me here. I&#8217;ll explain to you later. Your
story is the one that interests me. Tell me how
you came to be in that scow, Ralph.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fireman brought up the two satchels
from the hold of the old craft, and briefly related
to Joe the incidents of his experience with Farrington,
Slump and the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, you have done a big thing in getting
those satchels,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;and you want to place
them in safe hands at once. Come ashore, and
I&#8217;ll drive you to the nearest railroad town. You
don&#8217;t want to risk meeting any of your enemies
until you have those papers out of their reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they came up to the wagon, Ralph gazed
at its piled-up contents in surprise. The wagon
bottom was filled with walnuts and butternuts.
There must have been over twelve bushels of
them. On top of them was spread a lot of damp
rushes and all kinds of wild flowers, mosses and
grasses. Two large mud turtles lay under the
wagon seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what does all that layout mean?&#8221; exclaimed
Ralph, in amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said little Joe, with sparkling eyes, &#8220;is
an advertising scheme. Some time ago I discovered
the finest nut grove in the timber yonder you
ever saw. I suppose I could in time have gathered
up a hundred wagon loads of them. I intend to
make a heap of money out of them. A couple of
days ago, though, I thought out a great idea. You
know Woods, the dry goods man at the Junction?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a wide-awake, enterprising fellow, and
I told him of my scheme. It caught his fancy at
once. The plan was this: every week, I am to
trim up his show window with what we call &#8216;a
nature feature.&#8217; We keep pace with vegetation.
This week we show a swamp outfit; next week
pumpkins and the like; the following week
autumn leaves. We work in live objects like
turtles to give motion to the scene. Do you
catch on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an excellent idea and will attract lots of
attention,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it will,&#8221; assented his comrade with
enthusiasm. &#8220;Anyhow, my pay is fine and I expect
to work other towns in the same way. I will
show you the most artistic display window you
ever saw when I get this load of truck to town.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>In about two hours they reached a railroad
station, and somewhat later Ralph caught a train
for the city. He went at once to the office of the
president of the Great Northern. There was a
long interview. As Ralph left the railroad magnate
his face was pleased and his heart light and
hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; said Mr. Grant, &#8220;I cannot express
my satisfaction at your discoveries. It is as we
supposed&mdash;some individual has been encouraging
the strikers. There are ample proofs among these
papers of the fact that Gasper Farrington has
hired the strikers to commit all kinds of misdeeds
to scare stockholders of the road. He has thus
been enabled to buy up their stock at a reduced
figure, to make an enormous profit when the strike
is over. He had a scheme to tap our wires and
cause further complications and trouble. Within
a week the backbone of the strike will be broken,
and we shall not forget your agency in assisting
us to win out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went back to Stanley Junction that same
day. He related all his varied adventures to his
mother that evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing I discovered from those documents
in the satchels,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Farrington has
transferred all his property to Bartlett so we could
not collect the money he owes us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then we shall lose our twenty thousand dollars
after all,&#8221; said Mrs. Fairbanks anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see,&#8221; replied Ralph, with a mysterious
smile. &#8220;I am not yet through with Gasper
Farrington.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE LIMITED MAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>The conductor of the Limited Mail gave the
signal cheerily. Ralph swung in from his side of
the cab on the crack locomotive of the road. Old
John Griscom gave a chuckle of delight and the
trip to the city began.</p>
<p>It was ten days after the adventure in the scow&mdash;ten
days full of activity and progress in the
railroad interests of the Great Northern. This
was the morning when old-time schedules were
resumed and every part of the machinery of the
line went back to routine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, lad, it feels good to start out with
clear tracks and the regular system again. I&#8217;m
proud of you, Fairbanks. You did up those
strikers in fine style, and it will be a long time
before we shall have any more trouble in that
line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, Mr. Griscom,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;The
company seems determined to teach the strikers a
lesson.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>This was true. Immediately after the visit of
Ralph to the city, the railroad people had set at
work to make the most of the evidence in their
hands. A statement of the facts they had discovered
was given to the public, a series of indictments
found against Gasper Farrington, Bartlett,
Jim Evans and others, and a vigorous prosecution
for conspiracy was begun. Among the most important
witnesses against them was Zeph Dallas.
Farrington and Bartlett disappeared. Evans and
the others were sent to jail.</p>
<p>A great revulsion in popular sentiment occurred
when the true details of the strike movement were
made known. The respectable element of the old
union had scored a great victory, and work was
resumed with many undesirable employes on the
blacklist.</p>
<p>It seemed to Ralph now as though all unfavorable
obstacles in the way of his success had been
removed. He believed that Slump and Bemis
were powerless to trouble him farther. As to
Farrington, Ralph expected at some time to see
that wily old schemer again, for the railroad was
in possession of papers of value to the discredited
railroad magnate.</p>
<p>Ralph had now become quite an expert at his
work as a fireman. There was no grumbling at
any time from the veteran engineer, for Ralph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
had a system in his work which showed always in
even, favorable results. The locomotive was in
splendid order and a finer train never left Stanley
Junction. At many stations cheers greeted this
practical announcement of the end of the strike.</p>
<p>There was no jar nor break on the route until
they reached a station near Afton. The engine
was going very fast, when, turning a curve, Griscom
uttered a shout and turned the throttle
swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late!&#8221; he gasped hoarsely.</p>
<p>The young fireman had seen what Griscom
saw. It was an alarming sight. At a street crossing
a baby carriage was slowly moving down an
incline. A careless nurse was at some distance
conversing with a companion. The shrill shriek
of the whistle caused her to discover the impending
disaster, but she had become too terrified to
move.</p>
<p>Ralph readily saw that speed would not be
greatly diminished by the time the locomotive
overtook the child in the baby carriage, and in a
flash he acted. He was out on the running board
and onto the cowcatcher so quickly that he seemed
fairly to fly. Grasping a bracket, the young fireman
poised for a move that meant life or death
for the imperiled child.</p>
<p>The locomotive pounded the rails and shivered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
under the pressure of the powerful air brakes.
Ralph swung far down, one hand extended. The
baby carriage had rolled directly between the rails
and stood there motionless.</p>
<p>It contained a beautiful child, who, with an
innocent smile, greeted the approaching monster
of destruction as if it were some great, pleasing
toy. Ralph&#8217;s heart was in his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grab out!&#8221; yelled Griscom, fairly beside himself
with fear and suspense.</p>
<p>The young fireman&#8217;s eyes were dilated, his
whole frame trembled. Quick as lightning his hand
shot out. It met in a bunch of the clothing of the
child. He lifted; the vehicle lifted, too, for a
strap held in its occupant.</p>
<p>There was a terrific tension on the arm
of the young railroader. The lower part
of the vehicle was crunched under the cowcatcher
and the child was almost borne away with it.
Then the pressure lightened. With a great breath
of relief and joy Ralph drew the child towards
him, tangled up in the wreckage of the baby carriage.</p>
<p>The train stopped. Griscom did not say a word
as they backed down. His face was white, his
eyes startled, his breath came hard, but he gave his
intrepid young assistant a look of approbation and
devotion that thrilled Ralph to the heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></p>
<p>A crowd had gathered around the distracted
nurse at the street crossing. She was hysterical
as the rescued child was placed in safety in her
arms. Other women were crying. A big policeman
arrived on the scene. Griscom gave the particulars
of the occurrence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Name, please?&#8221; said the officer to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t necessary at all,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? Do you know whose child that is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The father is Judge Graham, the richest man
in the town. Why, he&#8217;d hunt the world over to
find you. A lucky fellow you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph gave his name and the train proceeded
on its way amid the cheers of the passengers, who
had learned of the brave act of the young fireman.
When terminus was reached, a fine-looking
old lady approached the locomotive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fairbanks,&#8221; she said to Ralph, &#8220;the passengers
desire you to accept a slight testimonial
of their appreciation of your bravery in saving
that young child.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph flushed modestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks like being paid for doing a simple
duty,&#8221; he said, as the lady extended an envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Mr. Fairbanks. It was a noble act,
and we all love you for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think more of that sentiment than this
money,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>The envelope contained fifty dollars. Griscom
told the story of the rescue all over Stanley Junction
next day, and the local newspapers made
quite an article of it.</p>
<p>The next morning Ralph had just completed
his breakfast, when his mother went to the front
door to answer the bell. She showed some one
into the parlor and told Ralph that a gentleman
wished to see him.</p>
<p>The young fireman was somewhat astonished,
upon entering the parlor, to be grasped by the
hand and almost embraced by a stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Judge Graham,&#8221; spoke the latter, in a
trembling, excited tone. &#8220;Young man, you saved
the life of my only child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was glad to,&#8221; said Ralph modestly.</p>
<p>The judge went on with a description of the
joy and gratitude of the mother of the child, of
his sentiments towards Ralph, and concluded with
the words:</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Mr. Fairbanks, I wish to reward
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That has been done already,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;in
your gracious words to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, not at all,&#8221; declared the judge.
&#8220;Come, don&#8217;t be modest. I am a rich man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I a rich mother in having so noble a son,&#8221;
spoke Mrs. Fairbanks, with deep emotion. &#8220;You
must not think of a reward, sir. He will not take
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a while the judge left the house, but he
did so with an insistent and significant declaration
that &#8220;he would not forget&#8221; Ralph.</p>
<p>The young fireman was surprised to see him
returning a few minutes later, in the company
of two of his own friends, Mr. Trevor, the
nephew of the president of the Great Northern,
and Van Sherwin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is a queer meeting,&#8221; cried Van
with enthusiasm, as they entered the house. &#8220;Here
we met Judge Graham, who is a great friend of
Mr. Trevor, and the very man we wished to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement was soon explained. It appeared
that Mr. Trevor had fully recovered
his health, and had come to Stanley Junction with
Van to make preparations to issue and sell the
bonds of the Short Cut Railroad. The judge was
one of the friends he had intended to interview
about buying some bonds.</p>
<p>For an hour young Trevor recited to Judge
Graham the prospects of the little railway line
and their plans regarding the same. Ralph was
fascinated at his glowing descriptions of its great
future.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Ralph&#8217;s visitors went away, but in a short time
Van returned to the cottage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Ralph,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;Judge Graham
is going to invest in those bonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I heard him tell Mr. Trevor to put down
an extra block of them in the name of Ralph
Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE PICNIC TRAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>Zeph Dallas had returned to work. His connection
with the strikers had been fully explained
to the railroad people by Ralph, and the farmer
boy was readily taken back into the service of the
company. Zeph boarded with Mrs. Fairbanks,
and Limpy Joe did, too, when he was in Stanley
Junction.</p>
<p>The enterprising Joe was winning his way famously.
His advertising scheme was a grand
success, and the nuts he gathered brought in a
good many dollars. One day he came to town
to announce that he was going to move his traps,
thanking Mrs. Fairbanks for her great kindness
to him in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to leave the Junction permanently,
Joe?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; answered the cripple. &#8220;You see, I
have been up to the headquarters of the Short
Line Railroad. They can use my horse and
wagon. They offer me a good salary to cook for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
them, and the concession of running a restaurant
when their line is completed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good opportunity, that, Joe,&#8221; said Ralph,
&#8220;although the main prospect you mention is far
in the future, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; declared Joe. &#8220;I guess you
haven&#8217;t kept track of proceedings in The Barrens.
Their telegraph line is clear through, both ways
from headquarters now. The bonds are nearly
all sold, and they expect to begin to lay the rails
in earnest next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed a good deal of activity at our end of
the line,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;I think the scheme is going
to be a success. I almost wish I was going to
work with you fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now drawing on towards late fall. For
several weeks the young fireman had not been
disturbed by his enemies. Work had gone on
smoothly. He was learning more and more every
day, and his savings amounted to quite a pretentious
sum.</p>
<p>The only outside issue that troubled Ralph was
the fact that they had not yet recovered the
twenty thousand dollars due his mother from old
Gasper Farrington. That individual had disappeared.
Ralph kept a sharp lookout, for upon
finding the magnate and bringing him to terms
depended the last chance of getting the money.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>There was the last picnic of the season one day,
and Ralph had been assigned to duty to look after
things generally. He was surprised when Forgan
took him off the run of the Limited Mail.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a sort of vacation holiday for you,
lad,&#8221; said the roundhouse foreman. &#8220;We want
somebody reliable to look after the train, with
so many women and children aboard. You will
be boss over the engineer, fireman and the whole
train crew for the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite an important commission,&#8221; said Ralph,
&#8220;but what will the train crew say about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they will be glad to work with the responsibility
on somebody else. Here is the
schedule. Be careful of your running time, Fairbanks.
I wouldn&#8217;t have anything happen to the
picnic train for worlds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph studied out the situation. When the
train left Stanley Junction he took a position in
the locomotive, attended to reports at all stations
they passed, and the train reached the picnic
grounds in safety and was run on the siding.</p>
<p>Ralph gave himself up to the enjoyment of a
real holiday. He knew nearly everybody on the
picnic grounds and nearly everybody there knew
him. About the middle of the afternoon a boy
living at the Junction came up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Ralph,&#8221; he remarked, tendering the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
young fireman a note. &#8220;A fellow out in the woods
gave me this for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph took the missive, and, opening it, read
its contents with mingled surprise and suspicion.
The note ran:</p>
<p>&#8220;If R. F. wants to hear of something to his
advantage, come to the old railroad bridge right
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no signature to the scrawl, but
Ralph quite naturally thought of Ike Slump and
his crowd. That did not, however, deter him
from going to keep the appointment. He cut a
stout cudgel and proceeded to the old railroad
bridge named in the note.</p>
<p>The young fireman glanced keenly about him,
but for some time did not get a view of anybody
in the vicinity. Finally from a clump of bushes
up the incline a handkerchief waved. Ralph
climbed the embankment to find himself facing
Ike Slump.</p>
<p>The latter was ragged and starved-looking. To
Ralph it appeared that the ex-roundhouse boy had
been having a decidedly hard time of it recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t carry any stick around here,&#8221; said
Slump, sullenly. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; answered Ralph, &#8220;although your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
actions in the past would warrant my having a
whole battery around me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s done with,&#8221; asserted Slump, quite
meekly. &#8220;Bemis is up there a little ways. You
needn&#8217;t be afraid of him, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you getting at with all this talk,
Ike?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we want to be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because we&#8217;re tired of starving and
being hunted and the like,&#8221; said Slump. &#8220;You
have won out, we are beaten. We want to work
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare I don&#8217;t understand what you are
driving at,&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Come, Ike Slump, play
no more crafty games. It don&#8217;t pay. Be honest
and straight. What did you bring me here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To make some money for both of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would give a good deal to find Gasper
Farrington, wouldn&#8217;t you, now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly am anxious to locate that man,
yes,&#8221; answered Ralph frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, we know where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are willing to make amends, I suppose,
for your past misconduct by telling me
where Farrington is to be found, so that I can
have him arrested.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess not!&#8221; cried Mort Bemis, coming
upon the scene. &#8220;We want pay for what we do.
We want a hundred dollars to begin with. A lot
more when you get that money he owes you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends,&#8221; said Ralph, promptly turning
from the spot. &#8220;Not a cent. I don&#8217;t believe you
know how to act square. You don&#8217;t show it by
your present proposition. If you really want to be
helped, and if you are sorry for your past wrong
doing, come back to Stanley Junction, tell the
truth, take your punishment like men, and I will
be your good friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a bold one,&#8221; sneered Slump, getting
very angry. &#8220;You won&#8217;t help us out, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With money&mdash;on your promise? No. I shall
find Gasper Farrington finally without your aid,
and, if you have nothing further to say, I shall
return to the picnic grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will,&#8221; said Bemis, roughly
placing himself in Ralph&#8217;s path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; inquired the young fireman calmly,
grasping his cudgel with a closer grip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;say, Ike, grab him, quick! If he
won&#8217;t deal with us and we can get him a prisoner,
Farrington will pay us. You know he always
wanted to get rid of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph prepared to meet the enemy squarely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Slump and Bemis rushed towards him. Before
they could begin the fight, however, a man burst
through the underbrush whom Ralph recognized
as a Stanley Junction police officer detailed on
picnic duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Found you, my friends, have I?&#8221; he hailed the
two fellows. &#8220;Grab one of them, Fairbanks, I&#8217;ve
got the other. I was on the lookout for them.
They stole a purse from the basket of an old lady
in the picnic grounds a few hours ago. Slump?
Bemis? Well, you are a fine pair, you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer insisted on arresting them, the more
so that upon recognizing them now he suddenly
remembered that a reward had been offered for
their apprehension by the railroad company. The
crestfallen plotters were taken to the train and
locked up in one end of the express car.</p>
<p>Ralph went to them after a spell and tried to
learn something more from them, but they were
now sullen and vengeful.</p>
<p>In due time the train was backed down to the
main track, the engine detached made a run for
water, and, returning, stood some little distance
from the cars.</p>
<p>The fireman and engineer left the engine to
help their families gather up their traps and take
them aboard the train. Ralph was busy in the
cab. He was looking over the gauges when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
sudden blow from behind stretched him insensible
on the coal of the tender.</p>
<p>As he slowly opened his eyes Ralph saw Slump
and Bemis in the cab. In some way they had
escaped, had stolen the locomotive, and were
speeding away to liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just heard a whistle. It must be the Dover
Accommodation,&#8221; Slump was remarking. &#8220;Get
off and open the siding switch, Mort.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Bemis did, and the engine started up
again. Ralph thrilled at the words Slump had
spoken. He was weak and dizzy-headed, but he
made a desperate effort, staggered to his feet and
sprang from the cab.</p>
<p>Had the locomotive remained at the picnic
grounds, the train would have been switched to
the siding again until the Accommodation passed.
As it was, unwarned, the Accommodation would
crash into the train.</p>
<p>Ralph heard its whistle dangerously near. He
looked up and down the tracks. Ahead, a bridge
crossed the tracks, and near it was a framework
with leather pendants to warn freight brakemen
in the night time. Towards this Ralph ran swiftly.
Weak as he was, he managed to scale the framework,
gained its center, and sat there panting,
poised for the most desperate action of his young
career.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>The Accommodation train came into view.
Ralph sat transfixed, knowing that he would soon
face death, but unmindful of the fact in the hope
that his action would save the lives of those
aboard the picnic train.</p>
<p>The Accommodation neared him. The young
fireman got ready to drop. He let go, crashed
past the roof of the cab, and landed between the
astonished engineer and fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The picnic train&mdash;on the main, stop your locomotive!&#8221;
he panted, and fainted dead away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>IN &#8220;THE BARRENS&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph Fairbanks had taken a terrible risk,
and had met with his first serious accident since
he had commenced his career as a young fireman.
When he next opened his eyes he was lying in his
own bed, a doctor and his mother bending solicitously
over him.</p>
<p>Slowly reason returned to him. He stared
wonderingly about him and tried to arise. A
terrible pain in his feet caused him to subside.
Then Ralph realized that he had suffered some
serious injury from his reckless drop into the
locomotive cab near the picnic grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, doctor?&#8221; he asked faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A bad hurt in one arm and some ugly bruises.
It is a wonder you were not crippled for life, or
killed outright.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The train&mdash;the picnic train!&#8221; cried Ralph,
clearly remembering now the incidents of the
stolen engine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Accommodation stopped in time to avert
a disaster,&#8221; said Mrs. Fairbanks.</p>
<p>Ralph closed his eyes with a satisfied expression
on his face. He soon sank into slumber. It was
late in the day when he awoke. Gradually his
strength came back to him, and he was able to
sit up in bed.</p>
<p>The next day he improved still more, and
within a week he was able to walk down to the
roundhouse. Forgan and all his old friends
greeted him royally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you have the nerve to think you are
going to report for duty,&#8221; observed Forgan.
&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t try. Orders are to sick list
you for a month&#8217;s vacation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be able to work in a week,&#8221; declared
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vacation on full pay,&#8221; continued the roundhouse
foreman.</p>
<p>Ralph had to accept the situation. He told his
mother the news, and they had a long talk over
affairs in general. The doctor advised rest and
a change of scene. The next day Van Sherwin
called on his way back to The Barrens. That
resulted in the young fireman joining him, and
his mother urged him to remain with his friends
and enjoy his vacation.</p>
<p>A recruit to the ranks of the workers of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Short Cut Railroad presented himself as Ralph
and Van left for the depot one morning to ride
as far as Wilmer. This was Zeph Dallas.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use talking,&#8221; said the farmer boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m
lonesome here at Stanley Junction and I&#8217;m going
to join Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Van, &#8220;if you think it wise
to leave a steady job here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;ll soon be able to give me a better
one, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; insisted Zeph. &#8220;It just suits
me, your layout down there in The Barrens. Take
me along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they reached Wilmer and left the train,
Van pointed proudly to a train of freight cars on
the Great Northern tracks loaded with rails and
ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our plunder,&#8221; he said cheerily. &#8220;Mr.
Trevor is hustling, I tell you. Why, Ralph, we
expect to have this end of the route completed
within thirty days.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they traversed the proposed railroad line,
Ralph was more and more interested in the project.
Little squads of men were busily employed
here and there grading a roadbed, and the telegraph
line was strung over the entire territory.</p>
<p>They reached the headquarters about noon. A
new sign appeared on the house, which was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
center of the new railroad system. It was
&#8220;Gibson.&#8221;</p>
<p>A week passed by filled with great pleasure for
the young railroader. Evenings, Mr. Gibson and
his young friends discussed the progress and
prospects of the railroad. There were to be two
terminal stations and a restaurant at the Springfield
end of the route. There were only two
settlements in The Barrens, and depots were to
be erected there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have quite some passenger service,&#8221;
declared Mr. Gibson, &#8220;for we shorten the travel
route for all transfer passengers as well as
freight. The Great Northern people do not at
all discourage the scheme, and the Midland
Central has agreed to give us some freight contracts.
Oh, we shall soon build up into a first-class,
thriving, little railroad enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>One evening a storm prevented Ralph from returning
to headquarters, so he camped in with
some workmen engaged in grading an especially
difficult part of the route. The evening was
passed very pleasantly, but just before nine
o&#8217;clock, when all had thought of retiring, a great
outcry came from the tent of the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him, I&#8217;ve caught the young thief,&#8221;
shouted the cook, dragging into view a small boy
who was sobbing and trembling with grief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row?&#8221; inquired one of the workmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve missed eatables for a week or more
at odd times, and I just caught this young robber
stealing a ham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t steal it,&#8221; sobbed the detected
youngster. &#8220;I just took it. You&#8217;d take it, too,
if you was in our fix. We&#8217;re nearly starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is nearly starved?&#8221; asked Ralph, approaching
the culprit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and dad. We were just driven to pick up
food anywhere. You&#8217;ve got lots of it. You
needn&#8217;t miss it. Please let me go, mister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the jail for you,&#8221; threatened the cook
direfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t take me away from my father,&#8221;
pleaded the affrighted youngster. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t
get along without me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, cook, let me take this little fellow in
hand,&#8221; suggested Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented the cook, adding in an
undertone, &#8220;give him a good scare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph took the boy to one side. His name was
Ned. His father, he said, was Amos Greenleaf,
an old railroader, crippled in an accident some
years before. He had become very poor, and they
had settled in an old house in The Barrens a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
miles distant. Ralph made up a basket of food
with the cook&#8217;s permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, Ned,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;you lead the
way to your home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have me arrested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you have been telling me the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; declared the young lad. &#8220;It&#8217;s
worse than I tell it. Dad is sick and has no medicine.
We have nearly starved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an arduous tramp to the wretched hovel
they at last reached. Ralph was shocked as he
entered it. It was almost bare of furniture, and
the poor old man who lay on a miserable cot was
thin, pale and racked with pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Ralph Fairbanks, a fireman on the Great
Northern,&#8221; said the young railroader, &#8220;and I came
with your boy to see what we can do for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A railroader?&#8221; said Greenleaf. &#8220;I am glad to
see you. I was once in that line myself. Crippled
in a wreck. Got poor, poorer, bad to worse, and
here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; said Ralph sympathizingly. &#8220;Why
have you not asked some of your old comrades to
help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are kind-hearted men, and did help me
for a time, till I became ashamed to impose on
their generosity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How were you injured, Mr. Greenleaf?&#8221;
asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a wreck. It was at the river just below
Big Rock. I was a brakeman. The train struck
a broken switch and three cars went into the creek.
I went with them and was crippled for life. One
of them was a car of another road and not so
high as the others, or I would have been crushed
to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A car of another road?&#8221; repeated Ralph with
a slight start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what road it belonged to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. They recovered the other two cars. I
never heard what became of the foreign car. I
guess it was all smashed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gondola?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, box car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was more and more interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did this occur, Mr. Greenleaf?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; said Ralph to himself, &#8220;that
I have at last found a clew to the missing car
Zeph Dallas and that car finder are so anxious to
locate?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>TOO LATE</h3>
</div>
<p>Two days later Ralph went down the line of
the little railroad to where it met the tracks of the
Great Northern. Mr. Gibson had sent him with
some instructions to the men at work there, and at
the request of the young fireman had assigned
him to work at that point.</p>
<p>This consisted in checking up the construction
supplies delivered by rail. Ralph had a motive in
coming to this terminus of the Short Line Route.
The information he had gained from the old,
crippled railroader, Amos Greenleaf, had set him
to thinking. He found Zeph Dallas working industriously,
but said nothing about his plans until
the next day.</p>
<p>At the noon hour he secured temporary leave of
absence from work for Zeph and himself, and
went to find his friend.</p>
<p>Zeph was a good deal surprised when Ralph
told him that they were to have the afternoon for
a ramble, but readily joined his comrade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Saw some friends of yours hanging around
here yesterday,&#8221; said the farmer boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Slump and Bemis. Guess they were after
work or food, and they sloped the minute they set
eyes on me. Say, where are you bound for anyway,
Ralph?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Wilmer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to look around the river near there.
The truth is, Zeph, I fancy I have discovered a
clew to that missing freight car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Zeph excitedly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
mean car No. 9176?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean just that,&#8221; assented Ralph. &#8220;Here, let
us find a comfortable place to sit down, and I&#8217;ll
tell you the whole story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph selected a spot by a fence lining the railroad
right of way. Then he narrated the details
of his interview with Amos Greenleaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; exclaimed Zeph, &#8220;I believe there&#8217;s something
to this. Every point seems to tally somehow
to what information the car finder gave me, don&#8217;t
you think so? Besides, in investigating the matter,
I heard about this same wreck. And five
years ago? Ralph, this is worth looking up, don&#8217;t
you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph was fairly incoherent amid his excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
He could not sit still, and arose to his feet and
began walking around restlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, it is a long time since the car disappeared,&#8221;
said Ralph, &#8220;and we may not be able
to find any trace of it. The car finder, in his
investigations, must have heard of this wreck.
Still, as you say, it is worth following up the clew,
and that is why I got a leave from work for the
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Zeph, looking in among the
bushes abruptly, &#8220;some one in there? No, I don&#8217;t
see anybody now, but there was a rustling there
a minute or two ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some bird or animal, probably,&#8221; said Ralph.
&#8220;Come on, Zeph, we will go to the bridge and
start on our investigations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The river near Wilmer was a broad stream.
It was quite deep and had a swift current. The
boys started down one bank, conversing and
watching out. Ralph laughed humorously after
a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy this is a kind of a blind hunt, Zeph,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We certainly cannot expect to find that
car lying around loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hardly, but we might find out where it
went to if we go far enough,&#8221; declared Zeph. &#8220;I
tell you, I shall never give it up now if I have to
go clear to the end of this river.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>They kept on until quite late in the afternoon,
but made no discoveries. They passed a little
settlement and went some distance beyond it.
Then Ralph decided to return to the railroad
camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Zeph, &#8220;only I quit work to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To find that car. I say, I&#8217;m thirsty. Let us
get a drink of water at that old farm house
yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went to the place in question and were
drinking from the well bucket when the apparent
owner of the place approached them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you have a cup or a glass, my lads?&#8221;
he inquired kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, this is all right,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;On a tramp, are you?&#8221; continued the farmer,
evidently glad to have someone to talk to.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, yes,&#8221; answered Ralph, and then,
a sudden idea struck him, he added: &#8220;By the
way, you are an old resident here, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty years or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you happen to remember anything of a
wreck at the bridge at Wilmer about five years
ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; mused the man. &#8220;That was the
time of the big freshet. Yes, I do remember it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
faintly. It&#8217;s the freshet I remember most though.
Enough timber floated by here to build a barn.
See that old shed yonder?&#8221; and he pointed to a
low structure. &#8220;Well, I built that out of timber
I fished ashore. Lumber yard beyond Wilmer
floated into the creek, and all of us along here got
some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about the wreck?&#8221; asked
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard about it at the time, that&#8217;s all. Sort of
connect the freshet with it. That was a great
washout,&#8221; continued the farmer. &#8220;Even sheds and
chicken coops floated by. And say, a box car,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Zeph, with a start as if he was
shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; said Ralph, with a suppressed
quiver of excitement in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It went whirling by, big and heavy as
it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister, you don&#8217;t know where that car
went to, do you?&#8221; inquired Zeph anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. I know right where it is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, old Jabez Kane, ten miles down the
creek, got it. He is using it now for a tool shed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; again cried Zeph, trembling with suspense
and hope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>Ralph nudged him to be quiet. He asked a
few more questions of the farmer and they left
the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; cried Zeph wildly, &#8220;we&#8217;ve found it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; answered the young fireman. &#8220;It
may not be the same car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going to find out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty late. We had better make a day of
it to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, if we can&#8217;t attend to it to-day,&#8221; said
Zeph disappointedly; and then both returned to
camp.</p>
<p>Next morning early both started for the creek
again. By proceeding across the country diagonally,
they saved some distance.</p>
<p>It was about noon when they approached a
rickety, old farmhouse which a man had told
them belonged to Jabez Kane.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is, there it is,&#8221; cried Zeph, as they
neared it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is an old box car in the yard near
the creek, sure enough,&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>They entered the farm yard. The box of the
car they looked at sat flat on the ground. It had
been whitewashed several times, it appeared, so
they could trace no markings on it. They approached
it and stood looking it over when a man
came out of the house near by.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey,&#8221; he hailed, advancing upon them.
&#8220;What you trespassing for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we?&#8221; inquired Ralph, with a pleasant
smile. &#8220;We mean no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno about that,&#8221; said the farmer suspiciously.
&#8220;Was you here last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sort of interested in this old car,&#8221; announced
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; demanded Kane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are looking for a car that floated
down the creek here about five years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the railroad?&#8221; asked the farmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, yes, in a way, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the railroad want to take it away from
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. They would like to know,
though, if it&#8217;s a car of the Southern Air Line
and numbered 9176.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, lad. This was just that car.
What&#8217;s the amazing interest in it all of a sudden?
Look here,&#8221; and he took them around to the other
side of the car. &#8220;Last night two boys came here;
my son saw them hanging around here. Then
they disappeared. This morning I found the car
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph and Zeph stared in astonishment. A four-foot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
space of the boards on the outside of the car
had been torn away. At one point there was a
jagged break in the inside sheathing. In a flash
the same idea occurred to both of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late!&#8221; groaned poor Zeph. &#8220;Some one
has been here and the diamonds are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was stupefied. He remembered the
rustling in the bushes when they were discussing
their plans the day previous. He believed that
their conversation had been overheard by some
one.</p>
<p>Ralph asked the man to send for his son, which
he did, and Ralph interrogated him closely. The
result was a sure conviction that Ike Slump and
Mort Bemis had secured the diamonds hidden in
the box car about five years previous.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE MAD ENGINEER</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Ralph. Another of my wild
dreams of wealth gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret about it, Zeph.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I help it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph had decided to return home. He was
now fully recuperated, and his vacation period
would expire in a few days.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the day when they had
discovered the missing box car only to find that
others had discovered it before them. Ralph had
arranged to flag a freight at the terminus of the
Short Line Route and was down at the tracks
awaiting its coming.</p>
<p>The freight arrived, Ralph clambered to the
cab, waved his hand in adieu to Zeph, and was
warmly welcomed by his friends on the engine.</p>
<p>They had proceeded only a short distance when
a boy came running down an embankment. So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
rapid and reckless was his progress that Ralph
feared he would land under the locomotive. The
lad, however, grasped the step of the cab, and was
dragged dangerously near to the wheels. Ralph
seized him just in time and pulled him up into the
cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; commented the engineer, &#8220;it&#8217;s a good
thing we were going slow. Here, land out as you
landed in, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried the boy, gazing back with
tear-filled eyes and trembling all over. &#8220;Please
let me ride with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Against the rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, there they are!&#8221; almost shrieked the boy,
pointing to two men who came rushing down the
embankment. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t let them get me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him a show till I learn his story,&#8221; said
Ralph to the engineer, so the latter put on steam
and the two men were outdistanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, thank you!&#8221; panted the boy,
clinging close to Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up on the water tank,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ll have a talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lad, whom the young fireman had befriended,
was a forlorn-looking being. He wore
no shoes, was hatless, and had on a coat many
sizes too large for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, what&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; inquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Ralph, when they were both seated on the water
tank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those men were pursuing me,&#8221; said the lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was running away from them. They are
my uncles, and they have been very wicked and
cruel to me. They want to send me to a reform
school to get rid of me, and locked me up. I ran
away this morning, but they got trace of me
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl Danvers. My father died and left them
my guardians. They are after the property, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you propose to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, anything to get away from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph talked for quite a while with the boy and
learned his entire history. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a case for a lawyer. Would you like
to come to Stanley Junction with me and have a
lawyer look into the matter for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I only want to escape from those bad
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will follow. You come with me. I will
interest myself in your case and see that you are
protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How kind you are&mdash;you are the only friend I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
ever knew,&#8221; cried the boy, bursting into tears of
gratitude.</p>
<p>Ralph took Earl Danvers home with him when
they reached Stanley Junction. His kind-hearted
mother was at once interested in the forlorn
refugee. They managed to fit him out with some
comfortable clothing, and Ralph told him to take
a rest of a few days, when he would have him
see their lawyer and tell him his story.</p>
<p>Two days later the young fireman reported at
the roundhouse for duty, and the ensuing morning
started on a new term of service as fireman of
the Limited Mail.</p>
<p>The first trip out Griscom was engineer. Ralph
noticed that he looked pale and worried. The run
to the city was made in a way quite unusual with
the brisk and lively veteran railroader. Ralph
waited until they were on their way home from
the roundhouse that evening. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Griscom, you have not been your usual
self to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, lad,&#8221; nodded the engineer gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything the matter especially?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a little extra care on my mind and under
the weather a bit besides,&#8221; sighed Griscom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you in any way?&#8221; inquired Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, lad&mdash;we must all bear our own troubles.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>The next day Griscom did not report for duty
at train time. A man named Lyle was put on
extra duty. Ralph did not know him very well
nor did he like him much. He understood that
he was a fine engineer but that he had been
warned several times for drinking.</p>
<p>As he came into the cab, Ralph noticed that his
eyes were dull and shifty, his hands trembled and
he bore all the appearance of a man who had been
recently indulging in liquor to excess.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out on the road, Lyle
began to drink frequently from a bottle he took
out of his coat. He became more steady in his
movements, and, watching him, Ralph saw that
he understood his business thoroughly and was
duly attentive to it.</p>
<p>After the wait at the city, however, Lyle came
aboard of the locomotive in quite a muddled condition.
He was talkative and boastful now. He
began to tell of the many famous special runs he
had made, of the big salaries he had earned, and
of his general proficiency as a first-class engineer.</p>
<p>He ordered full steam on, and by the time they
were twenty miles from the city he kept the locomotive
going at top notch speed. There was a
tremendous head on the cylinders and they ran
like a racer. Frogs and target rods were passed
at a momentum that fairly frightened Ralph, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
it was a wonder to him the way the wheels ground
and bounded that they always lit on the steel.</p>
<p>Lyle took frequent drinks from the bottle,
which had been replenished. His eyes were wild,
his manner reckless, almost maniacal. As they
passed signals he would utter a fierce, ringing yell.
Ralph crowded over to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Lyle,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;we are ahead of
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; roared the mad engineer, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to make the record run of the century.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If any other train is off schedule, that is
dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em look out for themselves,&#8221; chuckled
Lyle. &#8220;Whoop! pile in the black diamonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; almost shrieked Ralph.</p>
<p>Of a sudden he made a fearful discovery. A
signal had called for a danger stop where the
Great Northern crossed the tracks of the Midland
Central. Unheeding the signal, Lyle had run directly
onto a siding of the latter railroad and was
traversing it at full speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, stop, I say&mdash;there&#8217;s a car ahead,&#8221; cried
Ralph.</p>
<p>Lyle gave the young fireman a violent push
backwards and forged ahead.</p>
<p>Chug! bang! A frightful sound filled the air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
The locomotive had struck a light gondola car
squarely, lifting it from the track and throwing it
to one side a mass of wreckage. Then on, on
sped the engine. It struck the main of the Midland
Central.</p>
<p>Ralph grabbed up a shovel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lower speed,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;or I will strike you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back,&#8221; yelled Lyle, pulling a revolver from
his pocket. &#8220;Back, I say, or I&#8217;ll shoot. Whoop!
this is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph climbed to the top of the tender. He was
powerless alone to combat the engineer in his mad
fury. A plan came into his mind. The first car
attached to the tender was a blind baggage. Ralph
sprang to its roof. Then he ran back fast as he
could.</p>
<p>The young fireman lost no time, dropping from
the roof between platforms. As he reached the
first passenger coach he ran inside the car.</p>
<p>Passengers were on their feet, amazed and
alarmed at the reckless flight of the train. The
conductor and train hands were pale and frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; demanded the conductor,
as Ralph rushed up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A maniac is in charge of the train. He is
crazed with drink, and armed. Who of you will
join me in trying to overpower him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>None of the train hands shrank from duty.
They followed Ralph to the platform and thence
to the top of the forward coach. At that moment
new warnings came.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>A NEW MYSTERY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Danger,&#8221; shouted Ralph. &#8220;Quick, men. Do
you see ahead there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the rails a red signal fuse was spluttering.
It was quite a distance away, but they would
reach it in less than sixty seconds if the present
fearful speed of the train was kept up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that?&#8221; roared the conductor in a hoarse,
frightened tone.</p>
<p>Under the wheels there rang out a sharp crack,
audible even above the roar of the rushing train&mdash;a
track torpedo.</p>
<p>Ralph ran across the top of the forward car.
As he reached its front end, Lyle turning discovered
him.</p>
<p>He set up a wild yell, reached into the tender,
seized a big sledgehammer lying there and braced
back.</p>
<p>The young fireman was amazed and fairly terrified
at his movements, for Lyle began raining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
blows on lever, throttle and everything in the way
of machinery inside of the cab.</p>
<p>Past the red light, blotting it out, sped the train,
turning a curve. Ralph anticipated a waiting or
a coming train, but, to his relief, the rails were
clear. Ahead, however, there was a great glow,
and he now understood what the warnings meant.</p>
<p>The road at this point for two miles ran
through a marshy forest, and this was all on fire.
Ralph gained the tender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back, back!&#8221; roared Lyle, facing him, weapon
in hand. &#8220;She&#8217;s fixed to go, can&#8217;t stop her now.
Whoop!&#8221;</p>
<p>With deep concern the young fireman noted the
disabled machinery.</p>
<p>Half-way between centers, the big steel bar on
the engineer&#8217;s side of the locomotive had snapped
in two and was tearing through the cab like a
flail, at every revolution of the driver to which
it was attached.</p>
<p>Just as Ralph jumped down from the tender,
the locomotive entered the fire belt&mdash;in a minute
more the train was in the midst of a great sweeping
mass of fire. The train crew, blinded and
singed, retreated. Ralph trembled at a sense of
the terrible peril that menaced.</p>
<p>Lyle had drawn back from the lever or he
would have been annihilated. Then as the fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
swept into his face, he uttered a last frightful yell,
gave a spring and landed somewhere along the
side of the track.</p>
<p>The young fireman was fairly appalled. Such
a situation he had never confronted before. The
cab was ablaze in a dozen different places. The
tops of the cars behind had also ignited. Ralph
did not know what to do. Even if he could have
stopped the train, it would be destruction to do so
now.</p>
<p>Suddenly the locomotive dove through the last
fire stretch. Ahead somewhere Ralph caught the
fierce blast of a locomotive shrieking for orders.
For life or death the train must be stopped.</p>
<p>He flew towards the throttle but could not
reach it safely. The great bar threatened death.
Twice he tried to reach the throttle and drew
back in time to escape the descending bar. At a
third effort he managed to slip the latch of the
throttle, but received a fearful graze of one hand.
Then, exhausted from exertion and excitement,
the young fireman saw the locomotive slow down
not a hundred yards from a stalled train.</p>
<p>The passenger coaches were soon vacated by
the passengers, while the train crew beat out the
flames where the cars were on fire.</p>
<p>The Limited Mail made no return trip to Stanley
Junction that night. The following morning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
however, when the swamp fire had subsided, the
train was taken back to the Great Northern and
then to terminus.</p>
<p>Lyle, the engineer, was found badly burned and
delirious in the swamp, where he would have
perished only for the water in which he landed
when he jumped from the locomotive cab. He
was taken to a hospital.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of talk about the latest
exploit of the young fireman of the Limited Mail,
and Ralph did not suffer any in the estimation of
the railroad people and his many friends.</p>
<p>One evening he came home from an interview
with a local lawyer concerning the interests of
his young friend, Earl Danvers.</p>
<p>Ralph felt quite sanguine that he could obtain
redress for Earl from his heartless relations, and
was thinking about it when he discovered his
mother pacing up and down the front walk of
the house in an agitated, anxious way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, mother,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;you look very
much distressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so, truly,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fairbanks.
&#8220;Ralph, we have met with a great loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The house has been burglarized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time during the past three hours. I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
on a visit to a sick neighbor, and returned to discover
the rear door open. I went inside, and all
the papers in the cabinet and some money we had
there were gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers?&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, every document concerning our claim
against Gasper Farrington is missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what of Earl Danvers?&#8221; inquired Ralph.
&#8220;Was he away from home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was when I left, but he must have returned
during my absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cap he wore when he went away I found
near the cabinet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked serious and troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we have not been mistaken in believing
Earl to be an honest boy,&#8221; he said, and his mother
only sighed.</p>
<p>Then Ralph began investigating. The rear
door, he found, had been forced open. All the
rooms and closets had been ransacked.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is pretty serious, mother,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>Earl Danvers did not return that day. This
troubled and puzzled Ralph. He could not believe
the boy to be an accomplice of Farrington, nor
could he believe that he was the thief.</p>
<p>Next morning Ralph reported the loss to the
town marshal. When he went down the road, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
threw off a note where the men were working on
the Short Line Route at its junction with the
Great Northern. It was directed to Zeph Dallas,
and in the note Ralph asked his friend to look up
the two uncles of Earl Danvers and learn all he
could about the latter.</p>
<p>It was two nights later when Mrs. Fairbanks
announced to Ralph quite an important discovery.
In cleaning house she had noticed some words
penciled on the wall near the cabinet. They comprised
a mere scrawl, as if written under difficulty,
and ran:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;Earl prisoner. Two boys stealing things in
house. Get the old coat I wore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what can this mean?&#8221; said Ralph. &#8220;Earl
certainly wrote this. A prisoner? two boys? the
thieves? Get the old coat? He means the one he
wore when he came here. What can that have
to do with this business? Mother, where is the
coat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Ralph,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fairbanks, &#8220;I sold
it to a rag man last week.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FREIGHT THIEVES</h3>
</div>
<p>Two days later Zeph Dallas came to Stanley
Junction to purchase some supplies for Mr. Gibson&#8217;s
construction camp. In the evening he called
at the Fairbanks home. The farmer boy had
located the relatives of Earl Danvers, and his report
verified the story of the latter, who had disappeared
from home, and, according to his uncles,
his whereabouts was unknown to them.</p>
<p>Ralph related the story of the burglary, and
Zeph was at once interested. He believed that
some mystery of importance was attached to the
old coat. When he had gone away Ralph got to
thinking this over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;do you know the man
to whom you sold that old coat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; replied Mrs. Fairbanks. &#8220;He is
the man who goes around with an old wagon
visiting the different country towns in this district
in turn.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>Ralph made some inquiries, and ascertained that
the peddler in question made his headquarters at
Dover. He resolved upon opportunity to visit
the man at a near date, although it was probable
that the coat with the rags sold with it had been
sent to some mill. A few days later Zeph came
again to Stanley Junction and Ralph told him
about the peddler.</p>
<p>For a time after this, affairs ran on smoothly
for the Limited Mail and her experienced crew,
and Ralph had settled down to a quiet enjoyment
of congenial employment when there occurred a
break in the routine that once more placed him in
a position of peril.</p>
<p>One day as he returned from the city run, the
roundhouse foreman informed him that he was to
report at the office of the master mechanic. Ralph
did not go home, but went at once to answer the
summons.</p>
<p>The master mechanic was his good friend and
received him with his usual cordiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are pretty well
known to the officers of the road, and favorably,
too, I suppose you know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a pleasure to have you say so,&#8221; answered
the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem especially to value your ability in
running down crookedness and ferreting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
criminals,&#8221; pursued the master mechanic. &#8220;The
superintendent wired me today to have one road
detective start out on a certain case. I wired back
that Mr. Adair was engaged in a special case in
the city. The return was to relieve you of regular
duty and have you report at Afton this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph nodded to indicate that he understood,
but he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not like these interruptions to routine
duty, but I suppose the company knows where it
most needs a fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went down the road shortly after noon.
He reached Afton and reported at once to the
assistant superintendent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have ordered a substitute fireman on the
Mail for a week, Fairbanks,&#8221; said that official.
&#8220;I think we shall engage your services for that
length of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it some particular case, sir?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;A very important case, yes. We seem to have
got rid of incompetent employes and strikers,
thanks to you and others who stood by the company
in time of trouble. There is one thing, however,
that is bothering us. It bothers every road
more or less, but we won&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph waited for a further explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freight thieves, Fairbanks,&#8221; continued the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
official. &#8220;Some gang is regularly stealing from
the road. When, where and how it is done we
have been unable to ascertain. A train will leave
the city or the Junction, arrive at terminus, and
some valuable package will be missing. The car
seals will be all right, no one seems to have entered
the car, and yet the pilfering goes on. Will
you help us run down the thieves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will try,&#8221; answered Ralph. &#8220;What trains
seem to suffer most?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always the night freights,&#8221; replied the assistant
superintendent. &#8220;Now, take your time, spare
no expense, and go to work on this problem in
your usual effective way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph devoted the remainder of the day to
going up and down the road and familiarizing
himself with the various freight trains and their
schedules.</p>
<p>Just after dark he clambered into the cab of
the night freight leaving the city. It was a dark,
sleety night, for cold weather had just set in.</p>
<p>The engineer was a tried and trusty veteran in
the service. Ralph felt that he understood him,
and that he must trust him to a degree in order to
facilitate his own programme. He waited till the
fireman was busy outside on the engine, then he
spoke to the old engineer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barton, I am on special duty here tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so, lad?&#8221; inquired the engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose you know there is a good deal
of missing freight in these night runs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard so,&#8221; answered Barton, &#8220;but you see
that is the business of the conductor, so I haven&#8217;t
much troubled myself about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, you don&#8217;t care to have these things occur
in your runs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should say not! Working on the case, Fairbanks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, yes, Mr. Barton, and I want you to
keep it quiet, but assist me when you can. I will
be all over the train and the car tops to-night, and
wanted to explain why to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, lad. Just call on me if I can
help you. Hello, you, Woods!&#8221; bawled the engineer
suddenly to a fellow who appeared near
the cab side, &#8220;what you doing there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man slunk out of view at being addressed,
with a muttered remark that it was his own business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t like that fellow&mdash;caboose look-out,&#8221;
explained Barton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he did not overhear our conversation,&#8221;
spoke Ralph.</p>
<p>About mid-way of the train there was a gondola
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
oil car. It had an elevated runway so that train
hands could pass over it readily. Ralph selected
this car as a vantage point, and got aboard as the
train started on its way for Stanley Junction.</p>
<p>He was dressed as a tramp, looked the character
completely, and the false moustache he wore
effectually changed his face so that no persons
except familiar friends would easily recognize
him.</p>
<p>Ralph got down at one side of the big oil tank.
For the next hour he remained quiet. Finally, as
a brakeman passed over the platform, he climbed
up and kept track of his movements.</p>
<p>The man, however, simply passed up and down
the train and then returned to the caboose. Then
there was a stop. Ralph leaned from the car and
looked up and down the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Ralph suddenly, &#8220;there is
that fellow Woods working at the doors of the
cars a little ahead there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brakeman in question now came down the
length of the train. The engine was taking water.
He halted almost opposite the car Ralph was
hiding on. Suddenly he uttered a low, sharp
whistle, and it was answered. Three men appeared
from the side of the track, spoke to him,
bounded up on to the oil car, and crouched down
so near to Ralph that he could almost touch them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>Woods stood on the next track with his lantern
as if waiting for the train to start up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cars marked,&#8221; he spoke. &#8220;I&#8217;ll flash the glim
when the coast is clear. You&#8217;ll know the cases I
told you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no response. The locomotive
whistled, and the brakeman ran back to the caboose.
Ralph lay perfectly still. The three men
sat up against the railing of the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got the keys to the car ventilators?&#8221; asked one
of the men, finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; was the response. &#8220;Say, fellows, we
want to be wary. This is a clever game of ours,
but I hear that the railroad company is watching
out pretty close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they can&#8217;t reach us,&#8221; declared another
voice, &#8220;with Woods taking care of the broken
seals, and all kinds of duplicate keys, we can
puzzle them right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then one of them arose to his feet. He
stumbled heavily over Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he yelled, &#8220;who is this?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>A PRISONER</h3>
</div>
<p>The three men almost instantly confronted
Ralph, and one of them seized him, holding him
firmly.</p>
<p>Ralph quickly decided on his course of action.
He yawned in the face of the speaker and drawled
sleepily:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you waking a fellow up for?&#8221;</p>
<p>One held Ralph, another lit a match. They
were rough, but shrewd fellows. Instantly one of
them said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Disguised!&#8221; and he pulled off Ralph&#8217;s false
moustache. &#8220;That means a spy. Fellows, how
can we tell Woods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S&mdash;sh!&#8221; warned a companion&mdash;&#8220;no names.
Now, young fellow, who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;young fellow&#8221; was gone! In a flash
Ralph comprehended that he was in a bad fix, his
usefulness on the scene gone. In a twinkling he
had jerked free from the grasp of the man who
held him, had sprung to the platform of the oil
car and thence to the roof of the next box car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>Almost immediately his recent captor was after
him. It was now for Ralph a race to the engine
and his friend Barton.</p>
<p>The running boards were covered with sleet and
as slippery as glass, yet Ralph forged ahead. He
could hear the short gasps for breath of a determined
pursuer directly behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got you!&#8221; said a quick voice. Its owner
stumbled, his head struck the young fireman and
Ralph was driven from the running board.</p>
<p>He was going at such a momentum that in no
way could he check himself, but slid diagonally
across the roof of the car. There destruction
seemed to face him.</p>
<p>His pursuer had fallen flat on the running
board. Ralph dropped flat also, clutching vainly
at space. His fingers tore along the thin sheeting
of ice. He reached the edge of the car roof.</p>
<p>For one moment the young fireman clung there.
Then quick as a flash he slipped one hand down.
It was to hook his fingers into the top slide bar of
the car&#8217;s side door. The action drew back the
door about an inch. It was unlocked. Ralph
dropped his other hold lightning-quick, thrust his
hand into the interstice, pushed the door still
further back, and precipitated himself forward
across the floor of an empty box car.</p>
<p>There he lay, done up, almost terrified at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
crowding perils of the instant, marveling at his
wonderful escape from death.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must think I went clear to the ground,&#8221;
theorized Ralph. &#8220;I am safe for the present, at
least. What an adventure! And Woods is in
league with the freight thieves! That solves the
problem for the railroad company.</p>
<p>&#8220;An empty car,&#8221; he said, as he finally struggled
to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till the train stops again
and then run ahead to Barton. Hello!&#8221; he exclaimed
sharply, as moving about the car, his foot
came in contact with some object.</p>
<p>Ralph stood perfectly still. He could hear deep,
regular breathing, as of some one asleep. His
curiosity impelled him to investigate farther. He
took a match from his pocket, flared it, and
peered down.</p>
<p>Directly in one corner of the car lay a big,
powerful man. He was dressed in rags. His coat
was open, and under it showed a striped shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph, &#8220;a convict&mdash;an escaped
convict!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man grasped in one hand, as if on guard
with a weapon of defense, a pair of handcuffs
connected with a long, heavy steel chain. Apparently
he had in some way freed himself from
these.</p>
<p>Ralph flared a second match to make a still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
closer inspection of the man. This aroused the
sleeper. He moved, opened his eyes suddenly,
saw Ralph, and with a frightful yell sprang up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you!&#8221; he said, seizing Ralph. &#8220;After
me, are you? Hold still, or I&#8217;ll throttle you. How
near are the people who sent you on my trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t risk that,&#8221; shouted the man wildly.</p>
<p>In a twinkling he had slipped the handcuffs
over Ralph&#8217;s wrists. The latter was a prisoner so
strangely that he was more curious than alarmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to stop, are they?&#8221; pursued the man, as
there was some whistling ahead. &#8220;Mind you,
now, get off when I do. Don&#8217;t try to call, and
don&#8217;t try to run away, or I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train stopped and Ralph&#8217;s companion
pulled back the door. He got out, forcing Ralph
with him, and proceeded directly into the timber
lining the railroad, never pausing till he had
reached a desolate spot near a shallow creek.</p>
<p>Then the man ordered a halt. He sat down on
the ground and forced his captive to follow his
example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Ralph Fairbanks, a fireman on the Great
Northern Railroad,&#8221; promptly explained the
young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I infer from these handcuffs and your under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
uniform that you are an escaped convict,&#8221; answered
Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know a good many people, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, I do,&#8221; answered Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Stanley Junction?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About forty miles north of here. I live there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do? you do?&#8221; cried the convict, springing
up in a state of intense excitement. &#8220;Here, lad,
don&#8217;t think me harsh or mean, or cruel, but you
have got to stay with me. You would betray me
to the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I would not,&#8221; declared Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would, I know&mdash;it&#8217;s human nature.
There is a big reward out for me. Then, too, you
know people. Yes, you must stay with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help you any&mdash;why should you detain
me?&#8221; insisted Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must find a man,&#8221; cried the convict, more
wildly than ever&mdash;&#8220;or you must find him for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What man is that?&#8221; spoke Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know a Mr. Gasper Farrington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite well,&#8221; answered Ralph, rather startled
at the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the man!&#8221; shouted the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is singular, for I am very anxious
myself to find that same individual,&#8221; said the
young fireman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>Ralph felt that he was in the midst of a series
of strange adventures and discoveries that might
lead to important results, not only for the person
he had so strangely met, but for himself, as well.</p>
<p>This impression was enforced as he watched his
captor pace up and down the ground, muttering
wildly. He seemed to have some deep-rooted
hatred for Gasper Farrington. &#8220;Revenge,&#8221; &#8220;Punishment,&#8221;
&#8220;Justice,&#8221; were the words that he constantly
uttered. Ralph wondered what course he
could pursue to get the man down to a level of
coherency and reason. Finally the man said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, get up, we must find some shelter.&#8221;</p>
<p>After an hour of arduous tramping they came
to an old barn that had been partly burned down.
There was some hay in it. The convict lay down
on this, unloosed one handcuff from the wrist of
his prisoner, and attached the other to his own
arm and lay as if in a daze until daybreak.</p>
<p>Now he could inspect his prisoner clearly, and
Ralph could study the worn, frenzied face of his
captor. The latter had calmed down somewhat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; he said, finally, &#8220;I don&#8217;t dare to let you
go, and I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; spoke Ralph, &#8220;you are in deep
trouble. I don&#8217;t want to make you any more
trouble. Suppose you tell me all about yourself
and see if I can&#8217;t help you out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t dare to trust any one,&#8221; groaned
the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You spoke of Gasper Farrington,&#8221; suggested
Ralph. &#8220;Is he an enemy of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has ruined my life,&#8221; declared the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;And why do you seek him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To demand reparation, to drag him to the
same fate he drove me to. Just let me find him&mdash;that
is all I wish&mdash;to meet him face to face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph began to quietly tell the story of his own
dealings with the village magnate of Stanley
Junction. It had a great effect upon his auditor.
From dark distrust and suspicion his emotions
gradually subsided to interest, and finally to confidence.</p>
<p>It was only by gradations that Ralph led the
man to believe that he was his friend and could
help him in his difficulties.</p>
<p>The convict told a pitiful story. Ralph believed
it to be a true one. To further his own avaricious
ends, Farrington had devised a villainous plot to
send the man to the penitentiary. He had escaped.
He had documents that would cause Farrington
not only to disgorge his ill-gotten gains,
but would send him to jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get to where those documents are
hidden,&#8221; said the convict. &#8220;Then to find Farrington,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and I shall right your wrongs as well as my
own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph reflected deeply over the matter in hand.
He resolved on a course of proceedings and submitted
it to his companion.</p>
<p>He offered to take the convict to the isolated
home of Amos Greenleaf, where he could remain
safely in retirement. Ralph promised to get him
comfortable garments and provide for his board
and lodging. In a few days he would see him
again and help him to find Farrington.</p>
<p>The young fireman was now released from the
handcuffs. He calculated the location of the place
where Greenleaf lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about fifteen miles to the spot I told you
of,&#8221; he explained to the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we reach it without being seen by any
one?&#8221; anxiously inquired his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can take a route where we need not pass
a single habitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was afternoon when they reached the home
of old Amos Greenleaf.</p>
<p>Ralph experienced no difficulty in arranging
that the convict remain there for a few days. He
gave Greenleaf some money, and, promising to
see the convict very soon, proceeded to Wilmer.</p>
<p>The young fireman took the first train for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Afton, and reported what had occurred to the
assistant superintendent.</p>
<p>Two days later Woods and his companions
were in jail, and a great part of the stolen freight
plunder was recovered.</p>
<p>Woods confessed that he had duplicated keys
and seals for the doors and ventilators of the
freight cars, and the bold thieveries along the
Great Northern now ceased.</p>
<p>Ralph obtained leave of absence for a week.
He decided that it was worth while to try and find
Gasper Farrington. He went to the city, got
certain papers belonging to the magnate from Mr.
Grant, and went to Wilmer.</p>
<p>He was soon at the junction of the Springfield
&amp; Dover Short Cut Railroad and the Great
Northern. That terminus was completed. A
neat depot had been erected, and on the tracks of
the new railroad there stood a handsome locomotive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ralph!&#8221; cried Zeph Dallas, rushing forward
to greet his friend, as the young fireman appeared.
&#8220;Great news!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE LOST DIAMONDS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Great news, eh?&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will say so when you hear what I have
got to tell you,&#8221; declared Zeph Dallas. &#8220;Say, I
am going straight to headquarters. Come with
me. The news will keep till we get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented Ralph. &#8220;There is enough
going on around here to keep a fellow interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The new railroad?&#8221; spoke Zeph brightly. &#8220;I
should say so. Isn&#8217;t it just famous? I tell you,
some hustling work has been done here in the past
few weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph was amazed and delighted at the progress
made by the Short Line Railway. As said,
a new locomotive was on the rails at the terminus,
and a little depot had been built. Workmen were
busy as far down the line as he could see. In
fact, everything indicated that the road would
soon be in full operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tracks are laid both ways from headquarters,
except for a little distance on the Springfield
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
side,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;We expect passenger and
freight cars for the road to-day, and on Monday
we open the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in what capacity will you appear on that
grand occasion, Zeph?&#8221; inquired the young fireman
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conductor!&#8221; exploded the farmer boy, drawing
himself up proudly. &#8220;See here;&#8221; he drew
back his coat and revealed the biggest and most
elaborate &#8220;Conductor&#8221; badge manufactured. &#8220;We
expect that Earl Danvers will become our brakeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; cried Ralph with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earl Danvers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is at headquarters,&#8221; said Zeph. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
bother asking me about him now. You will soon
see him, and he will tell you his own story. Then,
too, Mr. Gibson wishes to see you particularly.
Here&#8217;s our hand-car, jump aboard. We&#8217;ll spin
along at a fine rate, I tell you, for the roadbed is
splendid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph found it so. It was a most interesting
journey to headquarters. There was only one
track, and on this the men had spent their energies
to great advantage, and commendable results
followed.</p>
<p>He was warmly welcomed by his friends,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
particularly so by Earl Danvers. Just as soon as
mutual greetings were over Ralph took Earl to a
pile of ties a little distance away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;seeing we
are alone, suppose you give an account of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earl Danvers was thin and pale. He looked as
if he had gone through some recent severe hardships,
but he smiled serenely as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to tell my story, now I am out of my
troubles, but I tell you, Ralph, I have had a hard
time of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Slump and Bemis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The afternoon I left Stanley Junction,
they were the fellows who forced me to go away
with them. They broke into your house, and I
found them ransacking it. They pitched on to
me, and tied me up. Then they recognized me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, had you known them before?&#8221; exclaimed
Ralph, in some surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out that I had. You remember the
first day that you saw me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had run away from my uncles that
morning. I had made up a package hurriedly,
containing shoes, coat and cap, and got away
through a window in the attic. I went about five
miles, when I ran right into two fellows in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
woods. They were Slump and Bemis. They got
mad at my stumbling over them, took away my
parcel and began to belabor me. I had to run to
keep from being terribly beaten. Then I sneaked
around, hoping to recover my parcel. They had
gone in swimming. My parcel had disappeared.
I had to have a coat. I grabbed one and ran away
with it. They yelled after me, but I outdistanced
them. Then later I ran across my uncles looking
for me. The rest you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the coat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; related Earl, &#8220;when those fellows
broke into your house, they inquired about that
coat. I at once saw that they had a great interest
in it. I told them I didn&#8217;t know where it was.
They insisted that I did. They ransacked the
house from top to bottom. They took me away
from town to a miserable hut where they were
staying. Until yesterday I was a prisoner there,
tied up, half-starved, and every day Slump would
come and demand to know if I was going to tell
him what had become of that coat. From the first
I knew that coat was what they were after when
they burglarized your house, and wrote what
words I could on the wall of your sitting room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;we found your message
there. Did you learn what their especial interest
was in the coat?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I overheard some of their conversation
a few days ago,&#8221; replied Earl. &#8220;That coat contained
some diamonds they found in an old box
car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Ralph. &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems so. I escaped yesterday. You had
told me about this place, and so I came here.
Zeph Dallas was my friend at once, when I told
him my story. Here he is now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph approached with a beaming face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairbanks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose Danvers has
told you how he came here, and his troubles with
Slump and Bemis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went to Dover yesterday and saw the
old rag man. He ransacked his stock and we
found the coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; spoke Ralph, expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and in an inside pocket were the diamonds.
Here they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zeph handed Ralph a moldy chamois skin bag.
With interest the young fireman inspected the
contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rich find, Zeph,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
must report to the car finder at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to the city to-day to see him,&#8221; explained
the former farmer boy.</p>
<p>Zeph left headquarters about noon. The next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
morning he reappeared. He was fairly gorgeous
attired in the uniform of a conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thousand dollars I get as a special reward
for the recovery of the diamonds,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
more when the car finder has seen their original
owner. I am to divide with you, Fairbanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; dissented Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I shall,&#8221; insisted Zeph. &#8220;And, by the
way, I have some news of importance for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; said Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You know where Trafton is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Midland Central.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Well, this morning on the platform
there, I saw a man in whom you are considerably
interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was that?&#8221; inquired the young fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bartlett, the fellow who was a partner of
Gasper Farrington in that wire-tapping scheme.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>JUSTICE AT LAST&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Ralph lost no time in making up his mind to
at once go to Trafton and endeavor to run down
Bartlett. He was the friend and confidant of
Gasper Farrington, and the latter the young fireman
was now determined to find.</p>
<p>He had his troubles for his pains. He got a
trace of Bartlett at Trafton, but lost it again. His
final clew was that Bartlett had last been seen
driving away from town in a covered wagon.</p>
<p>Ralph devoted the morning to these discoveries,
then he made for the home of Amos Greenleaf.
He cut across the timber for ten miles, and
late in the afternoon reached the miserable hovel
where the crippled railroader lived.</p>
<p>It was when he was within a few rods of the
place that a voice hailed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, Mr. Fairbanks, I have something to
tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph went to a copse near at hand where the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
speaker stood, as if in hiding. It was the escaped
convict. He was deeply excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to prepare you for a surprise before
you went into the house,&#8221; said the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Farrington!&#8221; cried the convict. &#8220;He
is there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he happen to come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man driving a covered wagon brought him.
Farrington was sick, dying. The other man carried
him into the house and said he would hurry
for a doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When was this?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hours ago. I have not shown myself to
Farrington yet. The man is certainly in a dying
condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better investigate affairs,&#8221; said Ralph,
and he proceeded to the house.</p>
<p>Gasper Farrington lay on a wretched cot in a
little bedroom. Ralph was amazed at the change
in the magnate since he had last seen him. Farrington
was thin, pale and weak. He was gasping
painfully for breath, and groaned wretchedly as
he recognized his visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Farrington,&#8221; said Ralph, &#8220;you are
a very sick man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am dying, Ralph Fairbanks,&#8221; moaned the
stricken Farrington. &#8220;You have your revenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish for no revenge&mdash;I truly am sorry to
see you in this condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here I am,&#8221; groaned Farrington&mdash;&#8220;a
miserable wreck, dying in a wretched hovel, the
end of all my plotting, and worst of all, robbed
of everything I own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By whom?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Bartlett, who has abandoned me. I know
it, and only this morning he got from me the
deeds conveying all my property to him. Once
recorded, I am a beggar, and can make no reparation
to those whom I have defrauded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that true?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He pretended he would drive to Wilmer,
record the deeds at Stanley Junction, return and
take me safely out of the country. Instead, he
has isolated me in this desolate place. Oh, to outwit
him, Fairbanks!&#8221; continued the magnate
eagerly. &#8220;I can yet defeat him if you can assist
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the bed is my box of private papers.
Unknown to Bartlett, last week, suspecting his
scheme to rob me, believing I was dying, I
executed deeds that distributed my property
among those whom I had wronged. One deed is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
for your mother to adjust that twenty thousand
dollar claim. Another is for a poor fellow I sent
to jail&mdash;an innocent man. Another places my
property in trust with your lawyer. Here they
are,&#8221; and Farrington took some documents from
the box that Ralph had handed him. &#8220;Now then,
act quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralph looked over the papers. They were what
the magnate described. He went outside and saw
the convict, showing him the deed containing the
name of &#8220;John Vance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that your name?&#8221; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; assented the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Farrington has done you tardy justice,&#8221;
and he explained the situation.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the young fireman was bounding
away towards Wilmer.</p>
<p>Ralph caught a train just as it was moving
away from the depot. He did not venture inside
the cars, for he saw that Bartlett was aboard, but
at the next station proceeded to the locomotive.</p>
<p>When the train reached the limits at Stanley
Junction, Ralph left it and boarded an engine on
another track bound for the depot.</p>
<p>He reached it some minutes in advance of the
other locomotive. A hurried run for the office of
the recorder, a swift delivery of the deeds, and
then Ralph hastened after the town marshal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>They came upon Bartlett leaving the office of
the recorder with a glum and puzzled face. In his
hand in a listless way he held some deeds which
he had evidently been told were worthless.</p>
<p>The man was disguised, but Ralph knew him
at once. The marshal stepped forward and
seized his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Bartlett,&#8221; he said sternly, &#8220;you are under
arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you want me? What&mdash;er&mdash;for?&#8221; stammered
the plotter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conspiracy in the recent railroad strike,&#8221; explained
the official. &#8220;Pretty serious, too&mdash;not to
mention that so-called accident you had on one of
the cars, for which you wanted damages.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a scowl on his face Bartlett turned and
confronted Ralph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so it&#8217;s you?&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the young fireman, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is some of your work!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, it is at the request of the man you
robbed, Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Gasper Farrington,&#8221; answered Ralph,
and this news caused the prisoner to turn pale and
stagger back. He realized that he had come to the
end of his plotting and must now suffer the consequences
of his misdeeds. He was marched off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
to jail, and it may be as well to state, was, later
on, sent to prison for a term of years.</p>
<p>Gasper Farrington did not linger long. Before
he died, however, he had a talk with Ralph and
with the convict, and signed several papers of
importance. He acknowledged all his wrong
doings, and did all in his power to straighten
matters out. His relatives came to his aid, and his
last hours on earth were made as comfortable as
circumstances permitted.</p>
<p>Two days after Farrington&#8217;s funeral came a
surprise for Ralph. He received word that Ike
Slump and Mort Bemis had been caught in a
tavern near Dover. Both of the roughs were in
rags and penniless, having lost what money they
had had. Both were turned over to the police,
and in due course of time each followed Bartlett
to prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It serves them right,&#8221; said Griscom, to Ralph.
&#8220;My! my! What a difference in boys! Do you
remember when you and Slump were both wipers
at the roundhouse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do indeed!&#8221; answered Ralph feelingly. &#8220;I
am sorry for Ike. But he has no one to blame but
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A holiday for us day after to-morrow, lad,&#8221;
went on the veteran engineer of the Limited Mail,
with a twinkle in his eye. &#8220;Guess you know why.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Opening of the other line?&#8221; queried the young
fireman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Special invitation for both of us,&#8221;
went on Griscom, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope everything pans out right,&#8221; said
Ralph. &#8220;Our friends have worked hard enough,
goodness knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day for the opening of the new railroad
came, and Ralph and the old engineer took the
early morning train for Wilmer. Not a few
friends accompanied them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great day for Van and for Mr. Gibson,&#8221;
said Ralph. &#8220;And a great day for Zeph and Earl
too,&#8221; he added, with a smile. Earl&#8217;s uncles had
been hailed into court, and a new guardian had
been appointed for the boy.</p>
<p>A little after noon that day the formal opening
of the Springfield &amp; Dover Railroad was celebrated.</p>
<p>Two beautiful passenger coaches were filled
with friends of the road and persons living near
Wilmer. The locomotive and cars were gaily decorated
with bunting. Limpy Joe was bustling
around his restaurant stand at the depot, happy
and chipper. Zeph Dallas was the proud conductor,
and Earl Danvers the brakeman of the
train. Mr. and Mrs. Gibson, Mrs. Fairbanks, Mr.
Trevor and some of their friends formed a party
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
by themselves. It was a regular gala occasion.
The first trip was a grand success. People along
the line greeted the train with glad cheers, and,
returning to headquarters, a sumptuous repast
was spread for the guests of the new road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we are a happy family party,&#8221; said
Farwell Gibson with enthusiasm, as, that evening,
his employes sat around the supper table at headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Trevor. &#8220;To-morrow actual
work begins. We have splendid prospects, loyal
employes, and the Springfield &amp; Dover Short
Line is a grand success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot too deeply announce my feelings towards
you, Fairbanks,&#8221; said Mr. Gibson. &#8220;It is
to your friendship and co-operation that I owe,
in a measure, all my good fortune in completing
the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A grand lad,&#8221; applauded old John Griscom
heartily. &#8220;His pluck and perseverance have helped
us all out of difficulties many a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers for the boy who helped to build
a railroad!&#8221; cried Zeph Dallas.</p>
<p>They were given with enthusiasm, and Ralph
had to respond with a speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this is the happiest moment of my
life,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I have been through some
strenuous times, but all has ended well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>And then what a cheer went up!</p>
<p>Ralph imagined that now, since his enemies had
been disposed of, quiet times were ahead. But
this was not to be. Adventures in plenty still
awaited him, and what some of them were will be
related in another story, to be called &#8220;Ralph on
the Overland Express; or, The Trials and
Triumphs of a Young Engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was certainly a great day, mother,&#8221; said
the young fireman, when he got home from the
celebration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Ralph,&#8221; answered Mrs. Fairbanks. &#8220;And
to think that you helped to make that day possible.
Oh, I am proud of you!&#8221; And she gave him a
fond caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the best of it is, that we have all those
thousands of dollars,&#8221; continued the young fireman.
&#8220;We are not exactly rich, but we are comfortably
situated, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Ralph! But listen to me. Do
you want to leave the railroad? You might go
into business, or go to college, or&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, mother! I was born to follow a railroad
life&mdash;I feel it. Who knows, some day I may
be the President of some road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true. Well, have your wish, Ralph.
They tell me now you are the best fireman in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
these parts. Soon you&#8217;ll have your engine
then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very happy!&#8221; finished Ralph.</p>
<p>And his eyes brightened as he thought of
splendid opportunities the future promised.</p>

in abundance&mdash;railroad wrecks, dashes through forest fires,
the pursuit of a &#8220;wildcat&#8221; locomotive, the disappearance of
